<h3 class="pageHeader">Google Terms of Service</h3>
<p><b>Welcome to Google!</b></p>
<p><b>1.	Your relationship with Google</b></p>
<blockquote>
	<p>1.1	Your use of Google’s products, software, services and web sites (referred to collectively as the “Services” in this document and excluding any services provided to you by Google under a separate written agreement) is subject to the terms of a legal agreement between you and Google.  “Google” means Google Inc., whose principal place of business is at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.  This document explains how the agreement is made up, and sets out some of the terms of that agreement.</p>
	<p>1.2	Unless otherwise agreed in writing with Google, your agreement with Google will always include, at a minimum, the terms and conditions set out in this document.  These are referred to below as the “Universal Terms”.</p>
	<p>1.3	Your agreement with Google will also include the terms of any Legal Notices applicable to the Services, in addition to the Universal Terms.  All of these are referred to below as the “Additional Terms”.  Where Additional Terms apply to a Service, these will be accessible for you to read either within, or through your use of, that Service.</p>
	<p>1.4	The Universal Terms, together with the Additional Terms, form a legally binding agreement between you and Google in relation to your use of the Services.  It is important that you take the time to read them carefully. Collectively, this legal agreement is referred to below as the “Terms”.</p>

	<p>1.5	If there is any contradiction between what the Additional Terms say and what the Universal Terms say, then the Additional Terms shall take precedence in relation to that Service.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>2.	Accepting the Terms</b></p>
<blockquote>
	<p>2.1	In order to use the Services, you must first agree to the Terms.  You may not use the Services if you do not accept the Terms.</p>
	<p>2.2	You can accept the Terms by:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>(A)	clicking to accept or agree to the Terms, where this option is made available to you by Google in the user interface for any Service; or</p>

		<p>(B)	by actually using the Services.  In this case, you understand and agree that Google will treat your use of the Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>2.3	You may not use the Services and may not accept the Terms if (a) you are not of legal age to form a binding contract with Google, or (b) you are a person barred from receiving the Services under the laws of the United States or other countries including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the Services.</p>
	<p>2.4	Before you continue, you should print off or save a local copy of the Universal Terms for your records.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>3.	Language of the Terms</b></p>
<blockquote>
	<p>3.1	Where Google has provided you with a translation of the English language version of the Terms, then you agree that the translation is provided for your convenience only and that the English language versions of the Terms will govern your relationship with Google.</p>

	<p>3.2	If there is any contradiction between what the English language version of the Terms says and what a translation says, then the English language version shall take precedence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>4.	Provision of the Services by Google</b></p>
<blockquote>
	<p>4.1	Google has subsidiaries and affiliated legal entities around the world (“Subsidiaries and Affiliates”).  Sometimes, these companies will be providing the Services to you on behalf of Google itself. You acknowledge and agree that Subsidiaries and Affiliates will be entitled to provide the Services to you.</p>
	<p>4.2	Google is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for its users.  You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Services which Google provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you.</p>
	<p>4.3	As part of this continuing innovation, you acknowledge and agree that Google may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to users generally at Google’s sole discretion, without prior notice to you. You may stop using the Services at any time.  You do not need to specifically inform Google when you stop using the Services.</p>
	<p>4.4	You acknowledge and agree that if Google disables access to your account, you may be prevented from accessing the Services, your account details or any files or other content which is contained in your account.</p>

	<p>4.5	You acknowledge and agree that while Google may not currently have set a fixed upper limit on the number of transmissions you may send or receive through the Services or on the amount of storage space used for the provision of any Service, such fixed upper limits may be set by Google at any time, at Google’s discretion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>5.	Use of the Services by you</b></p>
<blockquote>
	<p>5.1	In order to access certain Services, you may be required to provide information about yourself (such as identification or contact details) as part of the registration process for the Service, or as part of your continued use of the Services.  You agree that any registration information you give to Google will always be accurate, correct and up to date.</p>
	<p>5.2	You agree to use the Services only for purposes that are permitted by (a) the Terms and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).</p>
	<p>5.3	You agree not to access (or attempt to access) any of the Services by any means other than through the interface that is provided by Google, unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with Google. You specifically agree not to access (or attempt to access) any of
the Services through any automated means (including use of scripts or
web crawlers) and shall ensure that you comply with the instructions 
set out in any robots.txt file present on the Services.</p>
