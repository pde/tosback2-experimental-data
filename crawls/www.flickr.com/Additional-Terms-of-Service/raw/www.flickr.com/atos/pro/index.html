	<P>[Click <A href="index.html#gift">here</A> to review the Flickr Gift Purchaser Terms]</P>
	<P id="pro"><STRONG>THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE APPLIED TO FLICKR PRO 
	ACCOUNTS</STRONG></P>
	<H2>1. ACCEPTANCE OF YAHOO! TERMS</H2>

	<P>Welcome to Flickr pro. By using Flickr pro, you agree to these Additional 
	Terms located at <A href="index.html">http://www.flickr.com/atos/pro/</A> that 
	supplement the Yahoo! Terms of Service (TOS) located at <A href="http://www.flickr.com/utos_detect.gne">http://www.flickr.com/utos_detect.gne</A> 
	which is incorporated by reference, and you further agree to comply with the 
	Flickr Community Guidelines (Community Guidelines) located at <A href="http://www.flickr.com/guidelines.gne">http://www.flickr.com/guidelines.gne</A>.</P>
	<P>Yahoo! ("Flickr") reserves the right to update and change, from time to time, 
	these Additional Terms and all documents incorporated by reference. You can 
	always find the most recent version of this Additional Terms and the most recent 
	version of the Yahoo! Terms of Service at the URL indicated above.</P>
	<H2>2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE</H2>
	<H3>2.1 Flickr pro</H3>
	<P>Please click on the following link to learn what additional features Flickr 
	Pro provides to subscribers <A href="http://flickr.com/help/limits/#28">http://flickr.com/help/limits/#28</A> 
	</P>

	<H2>3. YAHOO! ID AND YAHOO! WALLET REQUIREMENT</H2>
	<P>To participate in the Service, you must have a valid Yahoo! ID. You must also 
	have a Yahoo! Wallet, which will save your credit card, billing and shipping 
	information and other information (your "Registration Data"). If you do not have 
	a Yahoo! ID or a Yahoo! Wallet, you will be prompted to complete the 
	registration process for them before you can pay for the Services. </P>
	<P>To use Yahoo! Wallet, you must provide true, accurate, and current 
	Registration Data and keep that information accurate. You, and not Yahoo!, are 
	responsible for any and all purchases made through your Yahoo! Wallet account or 
	in connection with your Yahoo! ID. Yahoo! is not responsible for unauthorized 
	purchases or errors made using your Yahoo! ID or your Yahoo! Wallet account. You 
	must resolve purchase-related disputes with and promptly report unauthorized use 
	of your card to your credit card company, online payment service, merchant, or 
	bank. Your liability for unauthorized use of your card may be limited by your 
	card issuer's agreement with you and/or by applicable law. In addition to the 
	uses of account information authorized by the TOS, Yahoo! may access, preserve, 
	monitor and disclose your card information in the good faith belief that such 
	action is reasonably necessary to verify your account, to identify or resolve 
	problems, or to respond to inquiries about the Service, provided, however, that 
	nothing in this section shall impose a duty on Yahoo! to make any such 
	disclosures. </P>
	<H2>4. PAYMENT TERMS</H2>
	<H3>4.1 General Terms</H3>
	<P>The current fee for the Service you have selected will automatically and 
	immediately be charged to your payment instrument or account on the date that 
	you click on the "Purchase Order" button in the ordering process. Fees charged 
	for one Service may not be credited towards other services. All currency 
	references are in U.S. dollars.</P>
	<H3>4.2 Payment for Subscription</H3>
	<P>Payment occurs on a pre-pay basis and payment will not be automatically 
	renewed at the end of the term. The amount you are to pay will depend upon which 
	term of subscription you choose. For example, if you choose one year of Flickr 
	pro, you will be charged for the one year price upfront. If you choose the two 
	year term of Flickr pro, you will be charged for the entire two year price 
	upfront. Please note: If you have received a Free pro Period, then you will not 
	be charged for those days covered by the Free pro Period. You will be contacted 
	in order to renew your Flickr pro account prior to the end of any expiration of 
	the account (either the expiration of a Free pro Period or a paid Flickr pro 
	term), at which point you may elect to purchase a new Flickr pro term. If you do 
	not elect to purchase a new Flickr pro term, your account will automatically 
	revert to a free Flickr account upon the expiration of your Flickr pro term or 
	Free pro Period and will be subject to the limitations of a free Flickr 
	account.</P>

	<H3>4.4 Account Updater</H3>
	<P>As a convenience to its users, Yahoo! subscribes to a third party service 
	that can refresh expired credit card or debit card numbers with the numbers of 
	replacement cards so that users' paid Services do not lapse because the payment 
	instrument initially on file with Yahoo! has expired ("Account Updater"). By 
	registering for the Service, you consent to Yahoo!'s disclosure of your 
	registration information to this third party service and to that service's use 
	of such information solely in connection with Account Updater. You also consent 
	to Yahoo!'s receipt and use of updated credit card or debit card account 
	information from your financial institution in connection with the provision of 
	the Service as provided in the TOS, these Additional Terms, and the Yahoo! 
	Privacy Policy. </P>
	<H3>4.5 Fraud Protections</H3>
	<P>To protect against potential fraud, Yahoo! may take steps to verify the 
	validity of the credit card information you provide to us. The verification 
	process may include debiting an amount between $0.01 and $0.99 from your credit 
	card account and then immediately crediting the same amount back to your credit 
	card, as well as asking you to verify the amount debited in order to confirm 
	that you are in possession of your credit card. Yahoo! will only use this 
	process to screen for fraud and will not otherwise debit your credit card 
	account except as part of a transaction conducted through your account for the 
	Service. By providing Yahoo! with your credit card information, you authorize 
	Yahoo! to debit and credit your credit card account for an amount less than one 
	dollar for such verification purposes.</P>
	<H3>4.6 Cancellation of Subscription</H3>
	<P>Please note, unless Flickr gives notice to the contrary, payment for 
	subscriptions are non-refundable. If you cancel your subscription before the end 
	of the term for which you paid, your cancellation will take effect immediately 
	and you will not be given any refund.</P>
	<H3>4.7 Termination</H3>
	<P>If your credit card is invalid for any reason, your Flickr pro account will 
	revert to a free Flickr account and will be subject to the limitations of a free 
	Flickr account; provided, however, that Flickr reserves the right to cancel your 
	account entirely in such case, whereupon all the information and content 
	contained within it will be deleted permanently. Flickr accepts no liability for 
	information or content that is deleted due to an invalid credit card.</P>
	<H2>5. FLICKR'S RESERVATION OF RIGHTS</H2>

	<P>Flickr expressly reserves the right to immediately modify, delete content 
	from, suspend or terminate your account and refuse current or future use of any 
	Yahoo! service, including Flickr pro, if Flickr, in its sole discretion believes 
	you have: (i) violated or tried to violate the rights of others; or (ii) acted 
	inconsistently with the spirit or letter of the TOS, the Community Guidelines or 
	these Additional Terms. In such event, your Flickr pro account may be suspended 
	or cancelled immediately in our discretion, all the information and content 
	contained within it deleted permanently and you will not be entitled to any 
	refund of any of the amounts you've paid for such account. Flickr accepts no 
	liability for information or content that is deleted.</P>
	<H2>6. INDEMNITY</H2>
	<P>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Flickr, and its subsidiaries, 
	affiliates, officers, agents, or other partners, and employees, from any claim 
	or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to 
	or arising out of your use of and access to Flickr pro, your violation of the 
	TOS, these Additional Terms or the Community Guidelines, your violation of any 
	rights of another person or entity, or your violation of any applicable laws or 
	regulations.</P>
	<H2>7. PRIVACY</H2>
	<P>Registration Data and certain other information about you are subject to our 
	Privacy Policy. For more information, see our full privacy policy at <A 
	href="http://privacy.yahoo.com/">http://privacy.yahoo.com/</A>.</P>
	<H2>8. AGE REQUIREMENTS FOR USE OF FLICKR PRO</H2>
	<P>Flickr pro is available for individuals aged 13 years or older. If you are 13 
	or older but under the age of 18, you should review these terms and conditions 
	with your parent or guardian to make sure that you and your parent or guardian 
	understand and agree to these terms and conditions.</P>
	<H2>9. OBJECTIONABLE MATERIAL</H2>

	<P>You understand that by using Flickr pro, you may encounter content that may 
	be deemed offensive, indecent, or objectionable, which content may or may not be 
	identified as having explicit subject matter. Nevertheless, you agree to use 
	Flickr pro at your sole risk and that Flickr shall not have any liability to you 
	for content that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable.</P>
	<H2>10. LOCATION OF LAWSUIT</H2>
	<P>The Yahoo! Terms of Service, which apply to your Flickr pro account, provides 
	that both you and Flickr agree to submit to the personal and exclusive 
	jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, 
	California.</P>
	<P id="gift"><STRONG>THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE APPLIED TO FLICKR GIFT 
	PURCHASES ONLY</STRONG></P>
	<H2>1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</H2>
	<P>Welcome to Flickr Gift Certificate. By purchasing a Flickr Gift Certificate, 
	you agree to these Gift Purchaser Terms located at <A href="http://www.flickr.com/gift_terms_purchaser.gne">http://www.flickr.com/gift_terms_purchaser.gne</A> 
	that supplement the Yahoo! Terms of Service ("TOS") located at <A href="http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/">http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/</A>, 
	which are incorporated by reference.</P>Separate Terms of Service govern the 
	redemption and use of the gift certificate and the use of the product by the 
	recipient, and must be agreed by the recipient of a gift certificate prior to 
	redemption of the gift certificate and use of the product. Those terms are 
	located at <A 
	href="http://www.flickr.com/gift_terms_redeemer.gne">http://www.flickr.com/gift_terms_redeemer.gne</A>. 
	Flickr reserves the right to update and change, from time to time, these Gift 
	Purchaser Terms and all documents incorporated by reference. You can always find 
	the most recent version of these Gift Purchaser Terms and the most recent 
	version of the Yahoo! Terms of Service at the URLs indicated above.

	<P></P>
	<H2>2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE</H2>
	<P>Certain Flickr services allow the purchase of gift certificates, in which the 
	cost of a subscription to that service may be given to another user as a gift. 
	Flickr Gift Certificates can only be purchased on the Flickr site, and a 
	particular gift certificate may only be applied toward the purchase of the 
	Flickr service for which it is being offered.</P>
	<P>Gift certificates can be purchased in set amounts to enable the recipient to 
	receive the Flickr service for which the gift certificate is made available by 
	Flickr. Flickr Gift Certificates may not be used to purchase other Flickr Gift 
	Certificates or any other Yahoo! Services or Yahoo! Gift Certificates.</P>
	<H2>3. ELIGIBILITY</H2>
	<P>A Flickr Gift Certificate may only be sold to persons above the age of 13. 
	Flickr reserves the right to restrict the availability of a Flickr Gift 
	Certificate to residents of certain U.S. states, with or without notice. 
	<P>A Flickr Gift Certificate is intended for use as a gift to an individual. A 
	Flickr Gift Certificate is non-transferable, and resale of a Flickr Gift 
	Certificate or use for unauthorized advertising, marketing, sweepstakes or other 
	promotional purposes is strictly prohibited. You agree that Flickr has the right 
	to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future 
	use of gift certificates and balances (or any portion thereof) obtained or used 
	under such circumstances.</P>
	<H2>4. FLICKR ID REQUIREMENT</H2>
	<P>In order to purchase a Flickr Gift Certificate, you must have a valid Yahoo! 
	ID. You must also have a Yahoo! Wallet, which will save your credit card, 
	billing and shipping information and other information (your "Registration 
	Data"). If you do not have a Yahoo! ID or a Yahoo! Wallet, you will be prompted 
	to complete the registration process for them before you can pay for the 
	Services. </P>
	<P>To use Yahoo! Wallet, you must provide true, accurate, and current 
	Registration Data and keep that information accurate. You, and not Yahoo!, are 
	responsible for any and all purchases made through your Yahoo! Wallet account or 
	in connection with your Yahoo! ID. Yahoo! is not responsible for unauthorized 
	purchases or errors made using your Yahoo! ID or your Yahoo! Wallet account. You 
	must resolve purchase-related disputes with and promptly report unauthorized use 
	of your card to your credit card company, online payment service, merchant, or 
	bank. Your liability for unauthorized use of your card may be limited by your 
	card issuer's agreement with you and/or by applicable law. In addition to the 
	uses of account information authorized by the TOS, Yahoo! may access, preserve, 
	monitor and disclose your card information in the good faith belief that such 
	action is reasonably necessary to verify your account, to identify or resolve 
	problems, or to respond to inquiries about the Service, provided, however, that 
	nothing in this section shall impose a duty on Yahoo! to make any such 
	disclosures. </P>

	<H2>5. FEES AND CHARGES</H2>
	<P>Flickr may, upon notice required by applicable laws, at any time: (i) change 
	the amount of, or basis for determining, any fee or charge related to any Flickr 
	Gift Certificate, or (ii) institute new fees or charges related to a Flickr Gift 
	Certificate.</P>
	<H2>6. NO REFUNDS</H2>
	<P>Once your order is processed and confirmed by Flickr, your gift certificate 
	purchase is final. You will not be able to cancel your Flickr gift certificate 
	order, and you will not be entitled to any refunds or credits.</P>
	<H2>7. EXPIRATION</H2>
	<P>A Flickr Gift Certificate does not expire. However, you understand and agree 
	that receipt and acceptance of the Flickr Gift Certificate by your intended 
	recipient will be deemed to have occurred when the recipient provides their 
	consent to Flickr to receive the gift or, in the case of a gift generating a 
	gift code, when the recipient enters the gift code associated with the Flickr 
	Gift Certificate on to the Flickr site and successfully applies the value 
	associated with that gift to their Flickr account. In the unlikely event that 
	your Flickr Gift Certificate is not received and accepted by your intended 
	recipient twelve (12) months from the date that your payment for such gift 
	certificate is finalized, then the Flickr Gift Certificate will be applied to 
	your own Flickr account. By way of example and not limitation, if you purchase a 
	one year Flickr Gift Certificate and the intended recipient of the Flickr Gift 
	Certificate does not receive and accept the one year certificate twelve (12) 
	months from the date of payment, one year of Pro status will be added to your 
	own Flickr account. There are presently no service fees for the maintenance of 
	unaccepted Flickr Gift Certificates.</P>
	<H2>8. NO REPLACEMENT</H2>
	<P>Flickr Gift Certificates will not be replaced if they are lost, stolen or 
	used without permission.</P>
	<H2>9. TERMINATION</H2>

	<P>Flickr reserves the right to close customer accounts and request alternative 
	forms of payment if a Flickr Gift Certificate is fraudulently obtained or used 
	on the Flickr site.</P>
	<H2>10. PRIVACY</H2>
	<P>Registration Data and certain other information about you is subject to our 
	Privacy Policy. For more information, see the Yahoo! Privacy Policy at <A 
	href="http://privacy.yahoo.com/">http://privacy.yahoo.com/</A>.</P>
	<H2>11. NO LIABILITY</H2>
	<P>A Flickr Gift Certificate is provided "AS-IS," and Flickr assumes no 
	responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery, misapplication or 
	failure to store any user communications personalization settings, or 
	balance.</P>
