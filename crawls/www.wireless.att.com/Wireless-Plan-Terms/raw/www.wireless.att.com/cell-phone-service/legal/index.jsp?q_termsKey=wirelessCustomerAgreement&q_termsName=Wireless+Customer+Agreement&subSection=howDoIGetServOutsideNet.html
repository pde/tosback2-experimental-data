					<p>If you terminate your Agreement within three (3) days of accepting the Agreement, you will be entitled to a 

refund of your activation fee, if any, but you must return the Equipment purchased in connection with your Agreement.
					<p>You may terminate this Agreement, for any reason and without incurring the Early Termination Fee, within 

thirty (30) days of accepting your Agreement, PROVIDED, you will remain responsible for any Services fees and charges incurred.  If you purchase 

Equipment directly from AT&amp;T in connection with your Agreement, but you terminate within 30 days and fail to return the Equipment to AT&amp;T, you 

will be subject to an Equipment Fee in the maximum amount of the difference between the no-commitment price of the Equipment and the amount you actually 

paid for the Equipment.  AT&amp;T may charge you a restocking fee for any returned Equipment.  Some dealers impose additional fees. 
					<p>You have received certain benefits from us in exchange for any Service Commitment greater than one month. If 

we terminate your Services for nonpayment or other default before the end of your Service Commitment, or if you terminate your Services for any reason 

other than (a) in accordance with the cancellation policy; or (b) pursuant to a change of terms, conditions or rates as set forth below, you agree to pay 

us with respect to each device identifier or telephone number assigned to you, in addition to all other amounts owed, an Early Termination Fee in the 

amount specified below ("Early Termination Fee"). If your Service Commitment includes the purchase of certain specified Equipment on or after June 1, 

2010, the Early Termination Fee will be $325 minus $10 for each full month of your Service Commitment that you complete. (For a complete list of the 

specified Equipment, check <a class="anchor" href="http://www.att.com/equipmentETF" 

onclick="base.winOpen(this.href,'equipmentETF',1000,600,0,0,'status=1,resizable=1,scrollbars=1'); return false;">att.com/equipmentETF</a>). Otherwise 

your Early Termination Fee will be $150 minus $4 for each full month of your Service Commitment that you complete. The Early Termination Fee is not a 

penalty, but rather a charge to compensate us for your failure to satisfy the Service Commitment on which your rate plan is based.
					<p>Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time after your Service Commitment ends with thirty (30) days 

notice to the other party. We may terminate this Agreement at any time without notice if we cease to provide Services in your area. We may interrupt or 

terminate your Services without notice:
					<ol class="decimal">
						<li>for any conduct that we believe violates this Agreement,</li>
						<li>if you behave in an abusive, derogatory, or similarly unreasonable manner with any of our 

representatives,</li>
						<li>if we discover that you are underage,</li>
						<li>if you fail to make all required payments when due,</li>
						<li>if we have reasonable cause to believe that your Equipment is being used for an unlawful purpose or 

in a way that (i) is harmful to, interferes with, or may adversely affect our Services or the network of any other provider, (ii) interferes with the use 

or enjoyment of Services received by others, (iii) infringes intellectual property rights, (iv) results in the publication of threatening or offensive 

material, or (v) constitutes spam or other abusive messaging or calling, a security risk, or a violation of privacy,</li>

					<p>Usage and monthly fees will be billed as specified in your customer service summary or rate plan information 

online. If the Equipment you order is shipped to you, your Services may be activated before you take delivery of the Equipment so that you can use it 

promptly upon receipt.   Thus, you may be charged for Services while your Equipment is still in transit.  If, upon receiving your first bill, you have 

been charged for Services while your Equipment was in transit, you may contact Customer Care 1-800-331-0500 to request a credit. Except as provided 

below, monthly Services and certain other charges are billed one month in advance, and there is no proration of such charges if Service is terminated on 

other than the last day of your billing cycle. Monthly Service and certain other charges are billed in arrears if you're a former customer of AT&amp;T 

Wireless and maintain uninterrupted Service on select AT&amp;T rate plans, however, if you elect to receive your bills for your Services combined with 

your wireline  phone bill (where available) you will be billed in advance as provided above. You agree to pay for all services used with your Device. 
					<p>AIRTIME AND OTHER MEASURED USAGE ("CHARGEABLE TIME") IS BILLED IN FULL-MINUTE INCREMENTS, AND ACTUAL AIRTIME 

AND USAGE ARE ROUNDED UP TO THE NEXT FULL-MINUTE INCREMENT AT THE END OF EACH CALL FOR BILLING PURPOSES. AT&amp;T CHARGES A FULL MINUTE OF AIRTIME USAGE 

FOR EVERY FRACTION OF THE LAST MINUTE OF AIRTIME USED ON EACH WIRELESS CALL. UNLESS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN YOUR PLAN, MINUTES WILL BE DEPLETED ACCORDING 

TO USAGE IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER: NIGHT AND WEEKEND MINUTES, MOBILE TO MOBILE MINUTES, ANYTIME MINUTES AND ROLLOVER, EXCEPT THAT MINUTES THAT ARE PART OF 

BOTH A LIMITED PACKAGE AND AN UNLIMITED PACKAGE WILL NOT BE DEPLETED FROM THE LIMITED PACKAGE. Chargeable Time begins for outgoing calls when you press 

SEND (or similar key) and for incoming calls when a signal connection from the caller is established with our facilities. Chargeable Time ends after you 

press END (or similar key), but not until your wireless telephone's signal of call disconnect is received by our facilities and the call disconnect 

signal has been confirmed.
					<p>All outgoing calls for which we receive answer supervision or which have at least 30 seconds of Chargeable 

Time, including ring time, shall incur a minimum of one minute airtime charge. Answer supervision is generally received when a call is answered; however, 

answer supervision may also be generated by voicemail systems, private branch exchanges, and interexchange switching equipment. Chargeable Time may 

include time for us to recognize that only one party has disconnected from the call, time to clear the channels in use, and ring time. Chargeable Time 

may also occur from other uses of our facilities, including by way of example, voicemail deposits and retrievals, and call transfers. Calls that begin in 

one rate period and end in another rate period may be billed in their entirety at the rates for the period in which the call began.
					<p>DATA TRANSPORT IS CALCULATED IN FULL-KILOBYTE INCREMENTS, AND ACTUAL TRANSPORT IS ROUNDED UP TO THE NEXT 

FULL-KILOBYTE INCREMENT AT THE END OF EACH DATA SESSION FOR BILLING PURPOSES. AT&amp;T CALCULATES A FULL KILOBYTE OF DATA TRANSPORT FOR EVERY FRACTION OF 

THE LAST KILOBYTE OF DATA TRANSPORT USED ON EACH DATA SESSION. TRANSPORT IS BILLED EITHER BY THE KILOBYTE ("KB") OR MEGABYTE ("MB"). IF BILLED BY MB, THE 

FULL KBs CALCULATED FOR EACH DATA SESSION DURING THE BILLING PERIOD ARE TOTALED AND ROUNDED UP TO NEXT FULL MB INCREMENT TO DETERMINE BILLING. IF BILLED 

BY KB, THE FULL KBs CALCULATED FOR EACH DATA SESSION DURING THE BILLING PERIOD ARE TOTALED TO DETERMINE BILLING. NETWORK OVERHEAD, SOFTWARE UPDATE 

REQUESTS, EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS, AND RESEND REQUESTS CAUSED BY NETWORK ERRORS CAN INCREASE MEASURED KILOBYTES. DATA TRANSPORT OCCURS WHENEVER YOUR DEVICE 

IS CONNECTED TO OUR NETWORK AND IS ENGAGED IN ANY DATA TRANSMISSION, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: (i) SENDING OR RECEIVING EMAIL, DOCUMENTS, OR OTHER 

CONTENT, (ii) ACCESSING WEBSITES, OR (iii) DOWNLOADING AND USING APPLICATIONS.  SOME APPLICATIONS, CONTENT, PROGRAMS, AND SOFTWARE THAT YOU DOWNLOAD OR 

THAT COMES PRE-LOADED ON YOUR DEVICE AUTOMATICALLY AND REGULARLY SEND AND RECEIVE DATA TRANSMISSIONS IN ORDER TO FUNCTION PROPERLY, WITHOUT YOU 

AFFIRMATIVELY INITIATING THE REQUEST AND WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE.  FOR EXAMPLE, APPLICATIONS THAT PROVIDE REAL-TIME INFORMATION AND LOCATION-BASED 

APPLICATIONS CONNECT TO OUR NETWORK, AND SEND AND RECEIVE UPDATED INFORMATION SO THAT IT IS AVAILABLE TO YOU WHEN YOU WANT TO ACCESS IT.  YOU WILL BE 

BILLED FOR ALL DATA TRANSPORT AND USAGE WHEN YOUR DEVICE IS CONNECTED TO OUR NETWORK, INCLUDING THAT WHICH YOU AFFIRMATIVELY INITIATE OR THAT WHICH RUNS 

AUTOMATICALLY IN THE BACKGROUND WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE, AND WHETHER SUCCESSFUL OR NOT.</p> 
					<p>If you select a rate plan that includes a predetermined allotment of Services (for example, a predetermined 

amount of airtime, megabytes or messages), unless otherwise specifically provided as a part of such rate plan, any unused allotment of Services from one 

billing cycle will not carry over to any other billing cycle. We may bill you in a format as we determine from time to time. Additional charges may apply 

for additional copies of your bill, or for detailed information about your usage of Services.  
					<p><strong>Delayed Billing:</strong>  Billing of usage for calls, messages, data or other Services (such as usage 

when roaming on other carriers' networks, including internationally) may occasionally be delayed.  Such usage charges may appear in a later billing 

cycle, will be deducted from Anytime monthly minutes or other Services allotments for the month when the usage is actually billed, and may result in 

additional charges for that month. Those minutes will be applied against your Anytime monthly minutes in the month in which the calls appear on your 

bill. You also remain responsible for paying your monthly Service fee if your Service is suspended for nonpayment. We may require payment by money order, 

cashier's check, or a similarly secure form of payment at our discretion.

					<p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.</strong>  
					<p>Summary:<br>
					Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by calling our customer service 

department at 1-800-331-0500. <strong>In the unlikely event that AT&amp;T's customer service department is unable to resolve a complaint you may have to 

your satisfaction (or if AT&amp;T has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve 

those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.</strong> Arbitration is more informal than 

a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to 

very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. <strong>Any arbitration under this Agreement 

will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.</strong> For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed 

$75,000, AT&amp;T will pay all costs of the arbitration. Moreover, in arbitration you are entitled to recover attorneys' fees from AT&amp;T to at least 

the same extent as you would be in court. 
					<p>In addition, under certain circumstances (as explained below), AT&amp;T will pay you more than the amount of 

the arbitrator's award and will pay your attorney (if any) twice his or her reasonable attorneys' fees if the arbitrator awards you an amount that is 

greater than what AT&amp;T has offered you to settle the dispute.

					<p>(1) AT&amp;T and you agree to arbitrate <strong>all disputes and claims</strong> between us. This agreement to 

arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:
					<ul class="circle">
						<li>claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in 

contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;</li>
						<li>claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating 

to advertising);</li>
						<li>claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a 

member of a certified class; and</li>
						<li>claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>References to "AT&amp;T," "you," and "us" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, 

predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or Devices under this or 

prior Agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. This arbitration agreement 

does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, including, for example, the Federal Communications 

Commission. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. <strong>You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and 

AT&amp;T are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.</strong> This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate 

commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive 

termination of this Agreement.
					<p>2) A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice 

of Dispute ("Notice"). The Notice to AT&amp;T should be addressed to: Office for Dispute Resolution, AT&amp;T, 1025 Lenox Park Blvd., Atlanta, GA 30319 

("Notice Address"). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). 

If AT&amp;T and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or AT&amp;T may commence an 

arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by AT&amp;T or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until 

after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or AT&amp;T is entitled. You may download or copy a form Notice and a form to initiate 

arbitration at <a class="anchor" href="http://www.att.com/arbitration-forms" 

onclick="base.winOpen(this.href,'arbitrationForms',1000,600,0,0,'status=1,resizable=1,scrollbars=1'); return false;">att.com/arbitration-forms</a>.
					<p>(3) After AT&amp;T receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, it will promptly 

reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $75,000. (The filing fee currently is $125 for claims under 

$10,000 but is subject to change by the arbitration provider. If you are unable to pay this fee, AT&amp;T will pay it directly upon receiving a written 

request at the Notice Address.) The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer 

Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by 

the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at <a class="anchor" href="http://www.adr.org" 

onclick="base.winOpen(this.href,'adr',800,600,0,0,'status=1,resizable=1,scrollbars=1'); return false;">adr.org</a>, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, 

or by writing to the Notice Address. (You may obtain information that is designed for non-lawyers about the arbitration process at <a class="anchor" 

href="http://www.att.com/arbitration-information" onclick="base.winOpen(this.href,'arbitrationInfo',1000,600,0,0,'status=1,resizable=1,scrollbars=1'); 

return false;">att.com/arbitration-information</a>.) The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, 

except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide. Unless AT&amp;T and you agree 

otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree 

that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, 

or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. 

Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the 

essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. Except as otherwise provided for herein, AT&amp;T will pay all AAA filing, 

administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds 

that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards 

set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to 

reimburse AT&amp;T for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if you initiate 

an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules.
					<p>4) If, after finding in your favor in any respect on the merits of your claim, the arbitrator issues you an 

award that is greater than the value of AT&amp;T's last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, then AT&amp;T will:
					<ul class="circle">
						<li>pay you the amount of the award or $10,000 ("the alternative payment"), whichever is greater; 

and</li>
						<li>pay your attorney, if any, twice the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse any expenses (including 

expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration ("the attorney 

premium").</li>
					</ul>
					<p>If AT&amp;T did not make a written offer to settle the dispute before an arbitrator was selected, you and your 

attorney will be entitled to receive the alternative payment and the attorney premium, respectively, if the arbitrator awards you any relief on the 

merits. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the 

attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.
					<p>(5) The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed in paragraph (4) supplements any right to attorneys' 

fees and expenses you may have under applicable law. Thus, if you would be entitled to a larger amount under the applicable law, this provision does not 

preclude the arbitrator from awarding you that amount. However, you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or costs. Although under some 

laws AT&amp;T may have a right to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, AT&amp;T agrees that it will not seek such 

an award.
					<p>(6) The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking 

relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. <strong>YOU AND AT&amp;T AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING 

CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE 

PROCEEDING.</strong> Further, unless both you and AT&amp;T agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not 

otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of 

this arbitration provision shall be null and void.
					<p>(7) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if AT&amp;T makes any 

future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) during your Service Commitment, you may reject any such change by 

sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing 

that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.

access by National Security and Emergency Preparedness personnel in the event of a disaster or emergency, coordination with other systems, equipment 

modifications and repairs, and problems with the facilities of interconnecting carriers. We may block access to certain categories of numbers (e.g., 976, 

900, and international destinations) at our sole discretion.

require third party products and/or services, which are subject to any applicable third party terms and conditions and may require separate purchase from 

and/or agreement with the third party provider. AT&amp;T is not responsible for any consequential damages caused in any way by the preceding hardware,

within our control, we will issue you, upon request, a credit equal to a pro-rata adjustment of the monthly Service fee for the time period your Service 

was unavailable, not to exceed the monthly Service fee. Our liability to you for Service failures is limited solely to the credit set forth above.

consequential losses or damages you or any third party may suffer by use of, or inability to use, Services, Software, or Devices provided by or through

directors, employees and agents harmless from and against any and all claims of any person or entity for damages of any nature arising in any way from or

personal injury), INCLUDING CLAIMS ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART FROM THE ALLEGED NEGLIGENCE OF AT&amp;T, or any violation by you of this Agreement. This 

obligation shall survive termination of your Service with AT&amp;T. AT&amp;T is not liable to you for changes in operation, equipment, or technology that 

cause your Device or Software to be rendered obsolete or require modification. 
					<p>SOME STATES, INCLUDING THE STATE OF KANSAS, DON'T ALLOW DISCLAIMERS OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITS ON

otherwise objectionable.  
					<p>We do not filter, edit or control voice, text, or email messages, or guarantee the security of messages. We 

can interrupt, restrict or terminate VMTT without notice, if your use of VMTT adversely impacts AT&amp;T's network, for example that could occur from 

abnormal calling patterns or an unusually large number of repeated calls and messages; or if your use is otherwise abusive, fraudulent, or does not 

comply with the law.  
					<p>You are solely responsible for and will comply with all applicable laws as to the content of any text messages 

or emails you receive from VMTT that you forward or include in a reply to any other person. You authorize AT&amp;T or a third party working on AT&amp;T's 

behalf to listen to, and transcribe all or part of a voicemail message and to convert such voicemail message into text/email, and to use voicemail 

messages and transcriptions to enhance, train and improve AT&amp;T's speech recognition and transcription services, software and equipment.
					<p>Charges for VMTT include the conversion of the voicemail message and the text message sent to your wireless 

device. Additional charges, however, may apply to receiving email on your wireless device from VMTT, as well as, replying to or forwarding VMTT messages 

via SMS (text) or email, depending on your plan.  
					<p>SMS (text messaging) blocking is incompatible with VMTT.  (If you do not have a texting plan on your handset, 

we add a texting pay per use feature when you add VMTT with text delivery.) If you are traveling outside the U.S. coverage area, you will incur 

international data charges for emails received from VMTT, as well as, charges for emails you respond to or forward from VMTT, unless you have an 

international data plan and the usage falls within the plan's usage limits. 
					<p>Transcription times cannot be guaranteed. Customers purchasing email delivery are responsible for providing a 

correct email address and updating the email address when changes to the email account are made.    
					<p>If you choose SMS (text) delivery, VMTT only converts the first 480 characters of a voicemail message into 

text and you will receive up to three text messages of a transcribed message.  The transcription, therefore, may not include the entire voicemail message 

with SMS delivery. Adding VMTT will create a new voicemail box and all messages and greetings will be deleted from your current voicemail box.

					<p>AT&T data plans are designed for use with only one of the following distinct device types: (1) Smartphones, 

(2) basic and Quick Messaging phones, (3) tablets, and (4) LaptopConnect cards, and (5) stand-alone Mobile Hotspot devices.  A data plan designated for 

one type of device may not be used with another type of device.  For example, a data plan designated for use with a basic phone or a Smartphone may not

A data tethering plan, however, may be purchased for an additional fee to enable tethering on a compatible device. An Activation Fee may apply for each 

data line.
					<p>Consumer data plans do not allow access to corporate email, company intranet sites, and other business

					<p>A voice plan is required on all voice-capable Devices, unless specifically noted otherwise in the terms 

governing your plan.  
					<p>An eligible tiered pricing data plan is required for certain Devices, including iPhones and other designated 

Smartphones.  Eligible voice and tiered pricing data plans cover voice and data usage in the U.S. and do not cover International voice and data usage and 

charges.  If it is determined that you are using a voice-capable Device without a voice plan, or that you are using an iPhone or designated Smartphone 

without an eligible voice and tiered data plan, AT&amp;T reserves the right to switch you to the required plan or plans and bill you the appropriate 

monthly fees.  In the case of the tiered data plan, you will be placed on the data plan which provides you with the greatest monthly data usage 

allowance. If you determine that you do not require that much data usage in a month, you may request a lower data tier at a lower monthly recurring fee.

							<p>Pooled Data Connect Plans ("Pooled Plans") available only to customers with a qualified 

AT&amp;T Business Agreement for wireless Services and their respective Corporate Responsibility Users ("CRUs"). Consolidated billing is required. WIN 

Advantage® may also be required. Within a single Foundation Account (FAN), Customer's CRUs on an eligible Pooled Plan aggregate or "pool" their included 

wireless data usage ("Included Usage"), creating a "Pool". 
							<p>To pool together, each CRU in the Pool must subscribe to a Pooled Plan that has the same 

amount of Included Usage and the same Additional Kilobyte charge ("Similar Pooled Plan"). Every billing cycle, each CRU first uses his or her Included 

Usage. If a CRU does not use all his or her Included Usage it creates an underage in the amount of unused kilobytes ("Under Usage"). If a CRU uses more 

than his or her Included Usage it creates an overage with respect to kilobytes of data usage ("Over Usage"). The Pool's Under Usage kilobytes and Over 

Usage kilobytes are then aggregated respectively and compared. If the aggregate Under Usage kilobytes exceed the aggregate Over Usage kilobytes, then no 

CRU in the Pool pays Additional Kilobyte charges. If the aggregate Over Usage kilobytes exceeds the aggregate Under Usage kilobytes, then the ratio of 

Under Usage kilobytes to Over Usage kilobytes is applied to the data usage of each CRU in the Pool with Overage Usage, resulting in a monetary credit 

against the corresponding Additional Kilobyte charges. 
							<p>For example, if a Pool has 900 Under Usage kilobytes and 1000 Over Usage kilobytes (90%), then 

each CRU with Over Usage will receive a credit equal to 90% of his or her Additional Kilobyte charges. CRUs changing price points or migrating to Pooled 

Plans during a bill cycle may result in one-time prorations or other minor impacts to the credit calculation. Credits will only appear on WIN Advantage®. 

Customer may have more than one Pool within a FAN provided that Customer may only have one Pool for Similar Pooled Plans within a FAN; however, an 

individual CRU can only be in one Pool at a time. 
							<p>	AT&amp;T reserves the right to limit the number of CRUs in a Pool due to business needs 

and system limitations. CRUs on Pooled Plans and CRUs participating in a legacy Pooled Data Connect plan pool created prior to February 17, 2006 ("Legacy 

Pool") cannot be in the same Pool but can be within the same FAN. End users on non-pooling AT&amp;T plans may be included in the same FAN as CRUs on 

Pooled Plans; however these non-pooling end users will not receive the pooling benefits or contribute Included Usage to a Pool.

							<p>Tethering is a wireless or wired method in which your AT&T mobile device is used as a modem or 

router to provide a Internet Access connection to other devices, such as laptops, netbooks, tablets, smartphones, other phones, USB modems, network 

routers, mobile hotspots, media players, gaming consoles, and other data-capable devices. AT&T data plans with tethering enabled may be used for 

tethering your AT&T Mobile device to other devices. If you are on a data plan that does not include a monthly megabyte allowance and additional data 

usage rates, you agree that AT&T has the right to impose additional charges if you use more than 5 GB in a month; prior to the imposition of any 

additional charges, AT&T shall provide you with notice and you shall have the right to terminate your Service (early termination charges may apply).

					<p>You are not liable for charges you did not authorize, but the fact that a call was placed from your Device is 

evidence that the call was authorized. You may submit documents, statements and other information to show any charges were not authorized. Unauthorized 

charges may include calls made to or from your phone or other Device after it was lost or stolen. 
					<p>If you notify us of any charges on your bill you claim are unauthorized, we will investigate. We will advise 

you of the result of our investigation within 30 days. If you do not agree with the outcome, you may file a complaint with the California Public 

Utilities Commission and you may have other legal rights. While an investigation is underway, you do not have to pay any charges you dispute or 

associated late charges, and we will not send the disputed amount to collection or file an adverse credit report about it.
