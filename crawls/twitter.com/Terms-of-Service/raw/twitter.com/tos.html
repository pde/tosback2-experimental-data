<h2>Terms of Service</h2>


<p>These Terms of Service ("<strong>Terms</strong>") govern your access to and use of the services and Twitterâ€™s websites (the "<strong>Services</strong>"), and any information, text, graphics, photos or other materials uploaded, downloaded or appearing on the Services (collectively referred to as "<strong>Content</strong>"). Your access to and use of the Services is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. By accessing or using the Services you agree to be bound by these Terms.
</p>

<h3>Basic Terms</h3>

<p>You are responsible for your use of the Services, for any Content you post to the Services, and for any consequences thereof. The Content you submit, post, or display will be able to be viewed by other users of the Services and through  third party  services and websites (go to the <a href="http://twitter.com/settings/account">account settings</a> page to control who sees your Content). You should only provide Content that you are comfortable sharing with others under these Terms.</p>

<p class="tip"><span class="tip">Tip</span> What you say on Twitter may be viewed all around the world instantly.  You are what you Tweet!</p>

<p>You may use the Services only if you can form a binding contract with Twitter and are not a person barred from receiving services under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdiction. You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations.</p>

<p>The Services that Twitter provides are always evolving and the form and nature of the Services that Twitter provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you.  In addition, Twitter may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to users generally and may not be able to provide you with prior notice. We also retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time without prior notice to you.</p>

<p>The Services may include advertisements, which may be targeted to the Content or information on the Services, queries made through the Services, or other information. The types and extent of advertising by Twitter on the Services are subject to change. In consideration for Twitter granting you access to and use of the Services, you agree that Twitter and its third party providers and partners may place such advertising on the Services or in connection with the display of Content or information from the Services whether submitted by you or others.</p>

<h3>Privacy</h3>
