<p><strong>Go Daddy complies with the EU Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union. Users in the European Union consent to the transfer to and processing of their personal information in the United States. &nbsp;We will respond to your request for access to modify or delete your information within thirty (30) days. </strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Other than as described in this Policy, we will not give any information about you to others without your express permission. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Information Collection and Use </strong></p>
<p>Our Site and mobile application use forms in which you give us contact information (including your name, address, telephone number, and email address) so you can place orders, request information and support, and make product suggestions. For certain services, we may also request a credit card number,&nbsp;government&nbsp;identification number, or other financial information. We will then create an account number for you.</p>
<p>We receive and store any information you enter on our Site, mobile application,&nbsp;or give us in any other way, including through email, telephone, or other communications with our customer service department. If you contact us for support, we will keep an internal record of what support was given.</p>
<p>We use your information to contact you regarding functionality changes to our products, our Site and mobile application, new Go Daddy services, and special offers we think you'll find valuable. If you would rather not receive this information, please see the "Updating Your Information" section below on how to change your preferences.</p>
<p>We may also use your information to present a co-branded offer with our partners or affiliates. If we collect information from you in connection with a co-branded offer, it will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the information and whose privacy statement applies.</p>
<p>We use information gathered about you from our Site or mobile application statistics (for example, your IP address or device operating system) to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Site and mobile application. We also gather broad demographic information from this data to help us improve our Site and mobile application and make your browsing and purchasing experience more enjoyable. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information, except as necessary to prevent fraud or abuse on our system.</p>
<p>Our Site and mobile application use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and receipts. We use cookies to identify you so you don't need to log in each time you visit our Site or mobile application. The cookies are linked to your customer number, which is associated with the information in your account.</p>
<p>Within our mobile application we use tracking technologies such as:&nbsp; CI codes (click tracking), ISC (source tracking), and ITC (item tracking codes, attached to purchases at an item level, used to determine where within the application a product was added).&nbsp; Our mobile application automatically collects the device's operating system, phone model, app version, and device ID, and the user's customer number.&nbsp; We report this data back to our&nbsp;Go Daddy web services.&nbsp; These results are not shared with any third parties and are used solely for deciding when to retire SDKs/OS versions and to identify characteristics of major users so that we may optimize our application for those user types.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We do not ask you for, access, or track any location-based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading our mobile application or services.&nbsp; We do not tie any personally identifiable information you submit within our mobile application to any of the tracking&nbsp;technologies that we use.</p>

Go Daddy has agreements with the business owners&nbsp;on Near.ME requiring them to maintain the privacy of your information; however, Go Daddy is not responsible for improper use by business owners of your information.</p>
<p>Any telephone calls or emails initiated by you through the Near.ME site will be used (and in the case of telephone calls, recorded) for marketing purposes.&nbsp; If you do not agree to such use, do not initiate any telephone calls or emails through the Near.ME site.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are a business owner that has created an Ad Page&nbsp;to advertise your business on the&nbsp;Near.ME site, you will be prompted to enter information about your business, including your business name, business address, and business hours. The business information that you enter will be publicly displayed on your Near.ME Ad Page.</p>

We will only share information about you that is necessary for the third party to provide the requested service. These companies are prohibited from retaining, sharing, storing or using your personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.</p>

<p>In order to provide certain services to you, we may on occasion supplement the personal information you submit to us with information from third party sources (<em>e.g., </em>information from our strategic partners, service providers, or the United States Postal Service).&nbsp; We do this to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our products and services to you, and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you.</p>
<p><strong>Contests/Surveys </strong></p>
<p>From time-to-time, we may provide you with the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys. If you choose to participate, we may request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these contests or surveys is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose the requested information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip code and age level - note that you must be 18 or above to enter). We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor site traffic, and to personalize our Site.</p>
<p>We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests. When we do, that company will be prohibited from using our users' personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.</p>
<p><strong>Targeted Advertisements</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go Daddy may display targeted offers to our customers based on the products currently owned by the customer.&nbsp; These offers will display as varying product banners.&nbsp; There is no personal or geolocation information collected within these product banners to build a profile about your activities or that is shared with third party advertising companies.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Tell-A-Friend </strong></p>
<p>If a user elects to use our referral service to inform a friend about our Site or mobile application, we ask the user for the friend's name and email address. Go Daddy will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit our Site. Go Daddy stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend may contact Go Daddy at <a href="mailto:support@godaddy.com">support@godaddy.com </a>to request the removal of this information from our database.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>What Happens to my Personal Information if I Terminate my Go Daddy Account? </strong></p>
<p>When your Go Daddy account is cancelled (either voluntarily or involuntarily) all of your personally identifiable information is placed in "deactivated" status on our relevant Go Daddy databases. However,&nbsp;deactivation of your account does not mean your personally identifiable information has been deleted from our database entirely. We will retain and use your personally identifiable information as necessary in order to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements.</p>
