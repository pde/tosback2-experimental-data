<p><span style="text-transform : uppercase;">THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, AND shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement or your use of this Site or the Services found at this Site.</span></p>

<p><strong class="heading1"><strong class="heading1">14</strong>. INDEMNITY</strong></p>

<p>You agree to protect, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Go Daddy and its officers, directors, employees, and agents, from and against any and all claims, demands, costs, expenses, losses, liabilities and damages of every kind and nature (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees) imposed upon or incurred by Go Daddy directly or indirectly arising from (i) your use of and access to this Site or the Services found at this Site; (ii) your violation of any provision of this Agreement or the policies or agreements which are incorporated herein; and/or (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any intellectual property or other proprietary right.&nbsp; The indemnification obligations under this section shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement or your use of this Site or the Services found at this Site.</p>

<p><strong class="heading1"><strong class="heading1">15</strong>. FEES AND PAYMENTS</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>(A) GENERAL TERMS, INCLUDING AUTOMATIC RENEWAL TERMS</em></strong></p>

<p>You agree to pay any and all prices and fees due for Services purchased at this Site at the time you order the Services.&nbsp; All prices and fees are non-refundable unless otherwise expressly noted, even if your Services are suspended, terminated, or transferred prior to the end of the Services term.&nbsp; Go Daddy expressly reserves the right to change or modify its prices and fees at any time, and such changes or modifications shall be posted online at this Site and effective immediately without need for further notice to you.&nbsp; If you have purchased Services for a period of months or years, changes or modifications in prices and fees shall be effective when the Services in question come up for renewal as further described below.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Where refunds are issued, Go Daddy's issuance of a refund receipt is confirmation that Go Daddy has submitted your refund to the Payment Method charged at the time of the original sale.&nbsp; You acknowledge and agree that the associated payment provider and/or individual issuing bank establish and regulate the time frames for posting your refund.&nbsp; Refund posting time frames may range from five (5) business days to a full billing cycle.</p>

<p>Except as prohibited in any product-specific agreement, you may pay for Services by providing a valid credit card, an electronic check (from your personal or business checking account, as appropriate), PayPal (as defined below), Alipay (as defined below), or by using Go Daddy&rsquo;s &ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Good As Gold Prepaid Services</span>&rdquo; to establish a cash reserve for charge by Go Daddy (each, a &ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Payment Method</span>&rdquo;).&nbsp; For Services that offer &ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Express Checkout</span>&rdquo;, clicking the Express Checkout button will automatically place an order for that Service and charge the primary Payment Method on file for your Account.&nbsp; Confirmation of that order will be sent to the email address on file for your Account. Your Payment Method on file must be kept valid if you have any active Services in your Account.</p>

<p>If you are being billed on a monthly basis, your monthly billing date will be based on the date of the month you purchased the Services unless that date falls after the 28th of the month, in which case your billing date will be the 28th of each month.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="text-transform : uppercase;">In order to ensure that you do not experience an interruption or loss of Services, most Services offer an automatic renewal option.&nbsp; The automatic renewal option automatically renews the applicable Service for a renewal period equal in time to the original service period.&nbsp; For example, if your original service period is for one year, your renewal period will be for one year.&nbsp; While the details of the automatic renewal option vary from Service to Service, the Services that offer an automatic renewal option treat it as the default setting.&nbsp; Therefore, unless you disable the automatic renewal option, Go Daddy will automatically renew the applicable Service when it comes up for renewal and will take payment from the Payment Method you have on file with Go Daddy at Go Daddy&rsquo;s then current rates, which you acknowledge and agree may be higher or lower than the rates for the original service period.&nbsp; In order to see the renewal settings applicable to you and your Services, simply log into your Account manager (&ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/gdshop/shopper_lookup.asp?isc=" target="_blank">Account Manager</a></span>&rdquo;) from this Site and follow the steps found <a href="http://help.godaddy.com/article/1042?prog_id=GoDaddy" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp; You may enable or disable the automatic renewal option at any time.&nbsp; However, should you elect to disable the automatic renewal option and fail to manually renew your Services before they expire, you may experience an interruption or loss of Services, and Go Daddy shall not be liable to you or any third party regarding the same.</span></p>

<p><span style="text-transform : uppercase;">In addition, Go Daddy may participate in &ldquo;recurring billing programs&rdquo; or &ldquo;account updater services&rdquo; supported by your credit card provider (and ultimately dependent on your bank&rsquo;s participation).&nbsp; If you are enrolled in an automatic renewal option and we are unable to successfully charge your existing Payment Method, your credit card provider (or your bank) may notify us of updates to your credit card number and/or expiration date, or they may automatically charge your new credit card on our behalf without notification to us.&nbsp; In accordance with recurring billing program requirements, in the event that we are notified of an update to your credit card number and/or expiration date, Go Daddy will automatically update your payment profile on your behalf. Go Daddy makes no guarantees that we will request or receive updated credit card information. You acknowledge and agree that it is your sole responsibility to modify and maintain your Account settings, including but not limited to (i) setting your renewal options and (ii) ensuring your associated Payment Method(s) are current and valid.&nbsp; Further, you acknowledge and agree that your failure to do so, may result in the interruption or loss of Services, and Go Daddy shall not be liable to you or any third party regarding the same.</span>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If for any reason Go Daddy is unable to charge your Payment Method for the full amount owed for the Services provided, or if Go Daddy is charged a penalty for any fee it previously charged to your Payment Method, you agree that Go Daddy may pursue all available lawful remedies in order to obtain payment. If you pay by credit card and if for any reason Go Daddy is unable to charge your credit card with the full amount owed for the Services provided, or if Go Daddy is charged back for any fee it previously charged to the credit card you provided, you agree that Go Daddy may pursue all available lawful remedies in order to obtain payment. You agree that the remedies Go Daddy may pursue in order to effect payment shall include, but not be limited to, immediate cancellation without notice to you of any domain names or Services registered or renewed on your behalf. Go Daddy reserves the right to charge you reasonable &ldquo;administrative fees&rdquo; or &ldquo;processing fees&rdquo; for (i) tasks Go Daddy may perform outside the normal scope of its Services, (ii) additional time and/or costs Go Daddy may incur in providing its Services, and/or (iii) your noncompliance with this Agreement (as determined by Go Daddy in its sole and absolute discretion). Typical scenarios include, but are not limited to, customer service issues that require additional personal time or attention, fees incurred by third-party payment providers such as PayPal, Alipay, and Certegy (as defined below), fees incurred as the result of chargebacks or other payment disputes brought by you, your bank, or a Payment Method processor, and disputes that require accounting or legal services. These administrative fees or processing fees will be billed to the Payment Method you have on file with Go Daddy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Go Daddy may offer product-level pricing in various currencies; however, transaction processing is supported only in U.S. dollars and a select number of the currency options displayed on this Site ("<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Supported Currency</span>" or &ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Supported Currencies</span>&rdquo;). If the currency selected is a Supported Currency, then the transaction will be processed in the Supported Currency and the pricing displayed during the checkout process will be the actual amount processed and submitted to your bank for payment. If the currency selected is not a Supported Currency, then the transaction will be processed in U.S. dollars and the pricing displayed during the checkout process will be an estimated conversion price at the time of purchase. In either case (whether the currency selected is a Supported Currency or not), if the transaction is processed in a currency that differs from the currency of your bank account, you may be charged exchange rate conversion fees by your bank.&nbsp; In addition, due to time differences between (i) the time you complete the checkout process, (ii) the time the transaction is processed, and (iii) the time the transaction posts to your bank statement, the conversion rates may fluctuate, and Go Daddy makes no representations or warranties that (a) the amount submitted to your bank for payment will be the same as the amount posted to your bank statement (in the case of a Supported Currency) or (b) the estimated conversion price will be the same as either the amount processed or the amount posted to your bank statement (in the case of a non-Supported Currency), and you agree to waive any and all claims based upon such discrepancies (including any and all claims for a refund based on the foregoing). In addition, regardless of the selected currency, you acknowledge and agree that you may be charged Value Added Tax ("<span style="text-decoration: underline;">VAT</span>"), Goods and Services Tax ("<span style="text-decoration: underline;">GST</span>"), or other localized fees and/or taxes, based on your bank and/or the country indicated in your billing address section.</p>

<p><em><strong>(B) GOOD AS GOLD PREPAID SERVICES</strong><strong></strong></em></p>

<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Service Details</span></em></p>

<p>By using Good As Gold Prepaid Services, you may transfer funds to Go Daddy in order to fund your Good As Gold Prepaid Services account (&ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Good As Gold Account</span>&rdquo;).&nbsp; You may then use your Good As Gold Account to purchase any of Go Daddy&rsquo;s Services.&nbsp; You may fund your Good As Gold Account by providing (i) a paper check (from your personal or business checking account, as appropriate), (ii) a money order, or (iii) a wire transfer.&nbsp; All payments must be for the full amount required at purchase.&nbsp; All paper checks and money orders may be delayed up to ten (10) business days until the money is credited, which may delay your use of the Services, and any paper check or money order that does not clear will result in a $25.00 processing fee by Go Daddy, which may be debited from your Good As Gold Account.&nbsp; The $25.00 processing fee is in addition to any fee(s) your bank may charge you. &nbsp;</p>

<p>You can verify the remaining funds in your Good As Gold Account at any time by logging into &ldquo;Manage Your Account&rdquo; or through the shopping cart on the Go Daddy website. Should you decide to terminate your Good As Gold Account and seek a refund, your refund will be made by check net of any discounts, including, but not limited to, reduced or waived wire transfer fees and/or the Cash Discount (as defined below).</p>

<p>You acknowledge that funds transferred to your Good As Gold Account will be held by Go Daddy and will not accrue or pay interest for your benefit. To the extent any interest may accrue, you understand and agree that Go Daddy shall be entitled to receive and keep any such amounts to cover costs associated with Good As Gold Prepaid Services.</p>

<p>You acknowledge that all transactions using Good As Gold Prepaid Services will be conducted in U.S. dollars and that it is your responsibility to arrange for foreign currency translations prior to funding your Good As Gold Account. Wire transfers received by Go Daddy in foreign currencies will be returned and you will be responsible for the cost of returning such funds. Your Good As Gold Account must be funded on an initial basis with no less than $100.00 paid in U.S. funds. You agree that you will be responsible for all wire transfer fees, both incoming and outgoing, associated with your Good As Gold Account. Any non-U.S. wire transfers may be subject to fees by your bank, intermediary banks, or Go Daddy&rsquo;s bank, which may reduce the amount of the money received by Go Daddy&rsquo;s bank and subsequently funded into your Good As Gold Account. Customers funding a Good As Gold Account with a wire of $1,000.00 or more shall not be subject to a $20.00 wire transfer processing fee from Go Daddy. You hereby expressly give Go Daddy permission to reduce your Good As Gold Account by the amount of wire transfer fees Go Daddy incurs in order to receive your funds.&nbsp; All fees are subject to change at any time, and such changes shall be posted online at this Site and effective immediately without need for further notice to you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Good As Gold Accounts will receive a two percent (2%) discount on purchases (the &ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cash Discount</span>&rdquo;).&nbsp; The Cash Discount will be reflected in your Good As Gold Account balance. Thus, purchases will reduce your Good As Gold Account balance by ninety-eight percent (98%) of the total purchase price of each transaction. For example, if your Good As Gold Account is funded with an initial amount of $100.00 and you make a $10.00 purchase, your Good As Gold Account will be reduced by only $9.80. Go Daddy reserves the right to discontinue or change the Cash Discount at any time, without notice.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Your Use of Good As Gold Prepaid Services </em></span></p>

<p>Use of funds in your Good As Gold Account can only be made through the Go Daddy purchase process at Go Daddy&rsquo;s website. Purchases may not be made unless there are sufficient, available funds in your Good As Gold Account at the time of purchase to cover the entire purchase amount, including any related fees as set forth herein or in other relevant agreements.</p>

<p>Additional funds may be added to your Good As Gold Account at any time. The minimum increment for funds transfers is $100.00.</p>

<p>You will be able to access your Good As Gold Account activity and records from the &ldquo;Manage Your Account&rdquo; link on Go Daddy&rsquo;s website. Your Good As Gold Account will show purchases and the amount of funds remaining in your Good As Gold Account. Go Daddy reserves the right at all times to disclose any information about your Good As Gold Account as Go Daddy deems necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, or to edit, refuse to post or to remove any information or materials, in whole or in part from your Good As Gold Account, in the sole and absolute discretion of Go Daddy.</p>

<p><em><strong>(C) PAY BY CHECK (ELECTRONIC CHECK)</strong><strong></strong></em></p>

<p>By using Go Daddy&rsquo;s pay by check option (&ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pay By Check</span>&rdquo;), you can purchase Go Daddy Services using an electronic check (from your personal or business checking account, as appropriate). In connection therewith, you agree to allow Certegy Check Services, Inc. (&ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Certegy</span>&rdquo;) to debit the full amount of your purchase from your checking account (&ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Checking Account</span>&rdquo;), which is non-refundable. Certegy will create an electronic funds transfer (&ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">EFT</span>&rdquo;) or bank draft which will be presented to your bank or financial institution for payment from your Checking Account. The Checking Account must be at a financial institution in the United States, and the check must be payable in U.S. dollars.</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to keep your Checking Account current and funded. You acknowledge and agree that (i) Certegy reserves the right to decline a transaction for any reason (including, but not limited to, payments that fail to go through as a result of your Checking Account no longer existing or not holding available/sufficient funds) and (ii) in such event, neither Certegy nor Go Daddy shall be liable to you or any third party regarding the same.&nbsp; If for any reason Certegy is unable to withdraw the full amount owed for the Services provided, you agree that Certegy and Go Daddy may pursue all available lawful remedies in order to obtain payment (plus applicable fees).&nbsp; Go Daddy is not responsible for the actions of Certegy.&nbsp; You agree that if the EFT or bank draft is returned unpaid, you will pay a service charge in accordance with the fees provided below, or as otherwise permitted by law. These fees may be debited from your Checking Account using an EFT or bank draft.&nbsp; All fees are in U.S. Dollars.</p>

The Alipay Fees are subject to change at any time by Alipay without notice to you by Go Daddy.</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to keep your Alipay Account and Alipay Funding Source current and funded.

You acknowledge and agree that Alipay reserves the right not to refund the Alipay Fees associated with an over-funded or under-funded transaction. &nbsp;Accordingly, any refunds issued by Go Daddy may be net of the Alipay Fees unless otherwise specified.</p>
