Google may, in its sole discretion, modify or revise these Terms of Service and policies at any time, and you agree to be bound by such modifications or revisions. If you do not accept and abide by this Agreement, you may not use the Blogger service. In the event of an inconsistency between the Blogger Terms of Service and either Google&#39;s general Terms of Service (<a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/terms_of_service.html">http://www.google.com/intl/en/terms_of_service.html</a>) or the Google Privacy Policy (<a href="http://www.google.com/privacy.html">http://www.google.com/privacy.html</a>), the Blogger Terms of Service (<a href="terms.g.html">http://www.blogger.com/terms.g</a>) shall control. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to confer any third-party rights or benefits.</p>
<div class="contents-depth2"><p><span class="item-title"><strong>1. Description of Service.</strong></span> Blogger is a web publishing service and optional hosting service (the &quot;Service&quot;). You will be responsible for all activities occurring under your username and for keeping your password secure. You understand and agree that the Service is provided to you on an AS IS and AS AVAILABLE basis. Google disclaims all responsibility and liability for the availability, timeliness, security or reliability of the Service or any other client software. Google also reserves the right to modify, suspend or discontinue the Service with or without notice at any time and without any liability to you.</p>

<p>Violation of any of the foregoing, including the Blogger Content Policy (<a href="http://www.blogger.com/content.g">http://www.blogger.com/content.g</a>), may result in immediate termination of this Agreement, and may subject you to state and federal penalties and other legal consequences.

<p>By their very nature, Blogger.com and Blogspot.com may carry offensive, harmful, inaccurate or otherwise inappropriate material, or in some cases, postings that have been mislabeled or are otherwise deceptive. We expect that you will use caution and common sense and exercise proper judgment when using Blogger.com and Blogspot.com.</p>

<p>Your Intellectual Property Rights. <strong>Google claims no ownership or control over any Content submitted, posted or displayed by you on or through Google services.</strong> You or a third party licensor, as appropriate, retain all patent, trademark and copyright to any Content you submit, post or display on or through Google services and you are responsible for protecting those rights, as appropriate. By submitting, posting or displaying Content on or through Google services which are intended to be available to the members of the public, you grant Google a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to reproduce, publish and distribute such Content on Google services for the purpose of displaying and distributing Google services.

<p>You represent and warrant that you have all the rights, power and authority necessary to grant the rights granted herein to any Content submitted.</p>
<p>You may choose to submit, post, and display any materials on or through the Blogger service or Blogspot.com under a public license (e.g. a  <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcreativecommons.org&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHfXAufI2FbP5-GLKDxTKe66Qg4Vg"> Creative Commons </a> license), whether by manually marking your materials as such or using Blogger service tools to do so. For avoidance of doubt, Google is not a party to any such public license between you and any third party. Also, for avoidance of doubt, Google may choose to exercise the rights granted under (a) the public license or licenses, if any, you apply to your materials or (b) this Agreement.</p>
<p><span class="item-title"><strong>7.

<p><span class="item-title"><strong>9. Representations and Warranties.</strong></span> You represent and warrant that (a) all of the information provided by you to Google to participate in the Service is correct and current; and (b) you have all necessary right, power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform the acts required of you hereunder.</p>
<p><span class="item-title"><strong>10. Termination; Suspension.</strong></span> Google may, in its sole discretion, at any time and for any reason, terminate the Service, terminate this Agreement, or suspend or terminate your account. In the event of termination, your account will be disabled and you may not be granted access to your account or any files or other content contained in your account although residual copies of information may remain in our system for some time for back-up purposes. Sections 2, 3, 5 - 8, and 10 - 15 of the Agreement, along with applicable provisions of the general Terms of Service (including the section regarding limitation of liability), shall survive expiration or termination.</p>
<p><span class="item-title"><strong>11. Indemnification.</strong></span> You agree to hold harmless and indemnify Google, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, and employees from and against any third-party claim arising from or in any way related to your use of the Service, including any liability or expense arising from all claims, losses, damages (actual and consequential), suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys&#39; fees, of every kind and nature.

<p><span class="item-title"><strong>13. Waiver and Severability of Terms.</strong></span> The failure of Google to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties&#39; intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms of Service remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p><span class="item-title"><strong>14. Statute of Limitations.</strong></span> You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising of or related to use of Google services or the Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.</p>
<p><span class="item-title"><strong>15. Choice of Law; Jurisdiction; Forum.</strong></span> These Terms of Service will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions or your actual state or country of residence.
