<H1>Comcast&nbsp;Acceptable Use Policy for High-Speed Internet</H1></div></div><div id="content"><div id="DFCMSave1" DFCMHtmlArea="Top section" DFCMEditable="True"><H3>Why is Comcast providing this Policy to me?</H3>
<P>Comcast's goal is to provide its customers with the best residential cable Internet service possible. In order to help accomplish this, Comcast has adopted this Acceptable Use Policy (the “Policy”). This Policy outlines acceptable use of the Comcast High-Speed Internet service (the “Service”). This Policy is in addition to any restrictions contained in the Comcast Agreement for Residential Services (the “Subscriber Agreement”) available at <A href="http://www.comcast.com/policies">http://www.comcast.com/policies</A>. The Frequently Asked Questions (“FAQs”) at <A href="http://help.comcast.net/">http://help.comcast.net</A> include explanations of how Comcast implements and applies many of the provisions contained in this Policy. All capitalized terms used in this Policy that are not defined here have the meanings given to them in the Subscriber Agreement. </P>
<H3>What obligations do I have under this Policy?</H3>
<P>All Comcast High-Speed Internet customers and all others who use the Service (the “customer,” “user,” “you,” or “your”) must comply with this Policy. Your failure to comply with this Policy could result in the suspension or termination of your Service account. If you do not agree to comply with this Policy, you must immediately stop all use of the Service and notify Comcast so that it can close your account.</P>
<H3>How will I know when Comcast changes this Policy and how do I report violations of it?</H3>
<P>Comcast may revise this Policy from time to time by posting a new version on the Web site at <A href="http://www.comcast.net/">http://www.comcast.net/</A> or any successor URL(s) (the “Comcast.net Web site”). Comcast will use reasonable efforts to make customers aware of any changes to this Policy, which may include sending email announcements or posting information on the Comcast.net Web site. Revised versions of this Policy are effective immediately upon posting. Accordingly, customers of the Comcast High-Speed Internet Service should read any Comcast announcements they receive and regularly visit the Comcast.net Web site and review this Policy to ensure that their activities conform to the most recent version. You can send questions regarding this Policy to, and report violations of it at, <A href="http://www.comcast.net/help/contact/">http://www.comcast.net/help/contact/</A>.

<H2>I. Prohibited Uses and Activities</H2><BR>
<H3>What uses and activities does Comcast prohibit?</H3>
<P>In general, the Policy prohibits uses and activities involving the Service that are illegal, infringe<BR>the rights of others, or interfere with or diminish the use and enjoyment of the Service by others.<BR>For example, these prohibited uses and activities include, but are not limited to, using the<BR>Service, Customer Equipment, or the Comcast Equipment, either individually or in combination<BR>with one another, to:</P>

<H2>II. Customer Conduct and Features of the Service</H2><BR>
<H3>What obligations do I have under this Policy?</H3>
<P>In addition to being responsible for your own compliance with this Policy, you are also responsible for any use or misuse of the Service that violates this Policy, even if it was committed by a friend, family member, or guest with access to your Service account. Therefore, you must take steps to ensure that others do not use your account to gain unauthorized access to the Service by, for example, strictly maintaining the confidentiality of your Service login and password. In all cases, you are solely responsible for the security of any device you choose to connect to the Service, including any data stored or shared on that device. Comcast recommends against enabling file or printer sharing unless you do so in strict compliance with all security recommendations and features provided by Comcast and the manufacturer of the applicable file or printer sharing devices. Any files or devices you choose to make available for shared access on a home LAN, for example, should be protected with a strong password or as otherwise appropriate.</P>
<P>It is also your responsibility to secure the Customer Equipment and any other Premises equipment or programs not provided by Comcast that connect to the Service from external threats such as viruses, spam, bot nets, and other methods of intrusion.</P>
<H3>How does Comcast address inappropriate content and transmissions?</H3>
<P>Comcast reserves the right to refuse to transmit or post, and to remove or block, any information or materials, in whole or in part, that it, in its sole discretion, deems to be in violation of Sections I or II of this Policy, or otherwise harmful to Comcast's network or customers using the Service, regardless of whether this material or its dissemination is unlawful so long as it violates this Policy. Neither Comcast nor any of its affiliates, suppliers, or agents have any obligation to monitor transmissions or postings (including, but not limited to, email, file transfer, blog, newsgroup, and instant message transmissions as well as materials available on the Personal Web Pages and Online Storage features) made on the Service. However, Comcast and its affiliates, suppliers, and agents have the right to monitor these transmissions and postings from<BR>time to time for violations of this Policy and to disclose, block, or remove them in accordance with this Policy, the Subscriber Agreement, and applicable law. </P>
<H3>What requirements apply to electronic mail?</H3>
<P>The Service may not be used to communicate or distribute email or other forms of communications in violation of Section I of this Policy. As described below in Section III of this Policy, Comcast uses reasonable network management tools and techniques to protect customers from receiving spam and from sending spam (often without their knowledge over an infected computer). Comcast's anti-spam approach is explained in the FAQs under the topic “What is Comcast doing about spam?” located at <A href="http://help.comcast.net/content/faq/Whatis-Comcast-doing-about-spam">http://help.comcast.net/content/faq/Whatis-Comcast-doing-about-spam</A>.</P>
<P>Comcast is not responsible for deleting or forwarding any email sent to the wrong email address by you or by someone else trying to send email to you. Comcast is also not responsible for forwarding email sent to any account that has been suspended or terminated. This email will be returned to the sender, ignored, deleted, or stored temporarily at Comcast's sole discretion. In the event that Comcast believes in its sole discretion that any subscriber name, account name, or email address (collectively, an “identifier”) on the Service may be used for, or is being used for, any misleading, fraudulent, or other improper or illegal purpose, Comcast (i) reserves the right to block access to and prevent the use of any of these identifiers<BR>and (ii) may at any time require any customer to change his or her identifier. In addition, Comcast may at any time reserve any identifiers on the Service for Comcast's own purposes. In the event that a Service account is terminated for any reason, all email associated with that account (and any secondary accounts) will be permanently deleted as well.</P>
<H3>What requirements apply to instant, video, and audio messages?</H3>
<P>Each user is responsible for the contents of his or her instant, video, and audio messages and the consequences of any of these messages. Comcast assumes no responsibility for the timeliness, mis-delivery, deletion, or failure to store these messages. In the event that a Service account is terminated for any reason, all instant, video, and audio messages associated with that account (and any secondary accounts) will be permanently deleted as well.</P>
<H3>What requirements apply to personal web pages and file storage?</H3>
<P>As part of the Service, Comcast provides access to personal Web pages and storage space through the Personal Web Pages and Online Storage features (collectively, the “Personal Web Features”). You are solely responsible for any information that you or others publish or store on the Personal Web Features. You are also responsible for ensuring that all content made available through the Personal Web Features is appropriate for those who may have access to it. For example, you must take appropriate precautions to prevent minors from receiving or accessing inappropriate content. Comcast reserves the right to remove, block, or refuse to post or store any information or materials, in whole or in part, that it, in its sole discretion, deems to be in violation of Section I of this Policy. For purposes of this Policy, “material” refers to all forms<BR>of communications including text, graphics (including photographs, illustrations, images, drawings, logos), executable programs and scripts, video recordings, and audio recordings. Comcast may remove or block content contained on your Personal Web Features and terminate your Personal Web Features and/or your use of the Service if we determine that you have violated the terms of this Policy.</P>
<H2>III. Network Management and Limitations on Data Consumption<BR></H2>
<H3>Why does Comcast manage its network?</H3>
<P>Comcast manages its network with one goal: to deliver the best possible broadband Internet experience to all of its customers. High-speed bandwidth and network resources are not unlimited. Managing the network is essential as Comcast works to promote the use and enjoyment of the Internet by all of its customers. The company uses reasonable network management practices that are consistent with industry standards. Comcast tries to use tools and technologies that are minimally intrusive and, in its independent judgment guided by industry experience, among the best in class. Of course, the company's network management<BR>practices will change and evolve along with the uses of the Internet and the challenges and threats on the Internet.</P>
<P>The need to engage in network management is not limited to Comcast. In fact, all large Internet service providers manage their networks. Many of them use the same or similar tools that Comcast does. If the company didn't manage its network, its customers would be subject to the negative effects of spam, viruses, security attacks, network congestion, and other risks and degradations of service. By engaging in responsible network management including enforcement of this Policy, Comcast can deliver the best possible broadband Internet experience to all of its customers. Visit Comcast's Network Management page at<BR><A href="http://www.comcast.net/terms/network/">http://www.comcast.net/terms/network/</A> for more information.</P>
<H3>How does Comcast manage its network?</H3>
<P>Comcast uses various tools and techniques to manage its network, deliver the Service, and ensure compliance with this Policy and the Subscriber Agreement. These tools and techniques are dynamic, like the network and its usage, and can and do change frequently. For example, these network management activities may include (i) identifying spam and preventing its delivery to customer email accounts, (ii) detecting malicious Internet traffic and preventing the distribution of viruses or other harmful code or content, (iii) temporarily lowering the priority of traffic for users who are the top contributors to current network congestion, and (iv) using other tools and techniques that Comcast may be required to implement in order to meet its goal of delivering the best possible broadband Internet experience to all of its customers.</P>
<H3>Are there restrictions on data consumption that apply to the Service?</H3>
<P>The Service is for personal and non-commercial residential use only. Therefore, Comcast reserves the right to suspend or terminate Service accounts where data consumption is not characteristic of a typical residential user of the Service as determined by the company in its sole discretion. Comcast has established a monthly data consumption threshold per Comcast High-Speed Internet account of 250 Gigabytes (“GB”). Use of the Service in excess of 250GB per month is excessive use and is a violation of the Policy. See the Network Management page at <A href="http://www.comcast.net/terms/network/">http://www.comcast.net/terms/network/</A> for more information and to learn how Comcast applies this Policy to excessive use. Common activities that may cause excessive data consumption in violation of this Policy include, but are not limited to, numerous or continuous bulk transfers of files and other high capacity traffic using (i) file transfer protocol (“FTP”), (ii) peer-to-peer applications, and (iii) newsgroups. You must also ensure that your use of the Service does not restrict, inhibit, interfere with, or degrade any other person's use of the Service, nor represent (as determined by Comcast in its sole discretion) an overly large burden on the network. In addition, you must ensure that your use of the Service does not limit or interfere with Comcast's ability to deliver and monitor the Service or any part of its network. If you use the Service in violation of the restrictions referenced above, that is a violation of this Policy. In these cases, Comcast may, in its sole discretion, suspend or terminate your Service account or request that you subscribe to a version of the Service (such as a commercial grade Internet service, if appropriate) if you wish to continue to use the Service at higher data consumption levels. Comcast may also provide versions of the Service with different speed and data consumption limitations, among other characteristics, subject to applicable Service plans. Comcast's determination of the data consumption for Service accounts is final.</P>
<H2>IV. Violation of this Acceptable Use Policy<BR><BR></H2>
<H3>What happens if you violate this Policy?</H3>
<P>Comcast reserves the right immediately to suspend or terminate your Service account and terminate the Subscriber Agreement if you violate the terms of this Policy or the Subscriber Agreement.</P>
<H3>How does Comcast enforce this Policy?</H3>
<P>Comcast does not routinely monitor the activity of individual Service accounts for violations of this Policy, except for determining aggregate data consumption in connection with the data consumption provisions of this Policy. However, in the company's efforts to promote good citizenship within the Internet community, it will respond appropriately if it becomes aware of inappropriate use of the Service. Comcast has no obligation to monitor the Service and/or the network. However, Comcast and its suppliers reserve the right at any time to monitor bandwidth, usage, transmissions, and content in order to, among other things, operate the Service; identify violations of this Policy; and/or protect the network, the Service and Comcast users.</P>
<P>Comcast prefers to inform customers of inappropriate activities and give them a reasonable period of time in which to take corrective action. Comcast also prefers to have customers directly resolve any disputes or disagreements they may have with others, whether customers or not, without Comcast's intervention. However, if the Service is used in a way that Comcast or its suppliers, in their sole discretion, believe violates this Policy, Comcast or its suppliers may take any responsive actions they deem appropriate under the circumstances with or without notice. These actions include, but are not limited to, temporary or permanent removal of content, cancellation of newsgroup posts, filtering of Internet transmissions, and the immediate<BR>suspension or termination of all or any portion of the Service (including but not limited to newsgroups). Neither Comcast nor its affiliates, suppliers, or agents will have any liability for any of these responsive actions. These actions are not Comcast's exclusive remedies and Comcast may take any other legal or technical actions it deems appropriate with or without notice.</P>
<P>Comcast reserves the right to investigate suspected violations of this Policy, including the gathering of information from the user or users involved and the complaining party, if any, and examination of material on Comcast's servers and network. During an investigation, Comcast may suspend the account or accounts involved and/or remove or block material that potentially violates this Policy. You expressly authorize and consent to Comcast and its suppliers cooperating with (i) law enforcement authorities in the investigation of suspected legal violations, and (ii) and system administrators at other Internet service providers or other network or computing facilities in order to enforce this Policy. Upon termination of your Service account, Comcast is authorized to delete any files, programs, data, email and other messages associated with your account (and any secondary accounts).</P>
<P>The failure of Comcast or its suppliers to enforce this Policy, for whatever reason, shall not be construed as a waiver of any right to do so at any time. You agree that if any portion of this Policy is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion will be construed consistent with applicable law as nearly as possible, and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Comcast and its affiliates, suppliers, and agents against all claims and expenses (including reasonable attorney fees) resulting from any violation of this Policy. Your indemnification will survive any termination of the Subscriber Agreement.</P>
<H2>V. Copyright and Digital Millennium Copyright Act Requirements</H2><BR>
<H3>What is Comcast's DMCA policy?</H3>
<P>Comcast is committed to complying with U.S. copyright and related laws, and requires all customers and users of the Service to comply with these laws. Accordingly, you may not store any material or content on, or disseminate any material or content over, the Service (or any part of the Service) in any manner that constitutes an infringement of third party intellectual property rights, including rights granted by U.S. copyright law. Owners of copyrighted works who believe that their rights under U.S. copyright law have been infringed may take advantage of certain provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) to report alleged infringements. It is Comcast's policy in accordance with the DMCA and other applicable laws to reserve the right to terminate the Service provided to any customer or user who is either found to infringe third party copyright or other intellectual property rights, including repeat infringers, or who Comcast, in its sole discretion, believes is infringing these rights. Comcast may terminate the Service at any time with or without notice for any affected customer or user.</P>
<H3>How do copyright owners report alleged infringements to Comcast?</H3>
<P>Copyright owners may report alleged infringements of their works that are stored on the Service or the Personal Web Features by sending Comcast's authorized agent a notification of claimed infringement that satisfies the requirements of the DMCA. Upon Comcast's receipt of a satisfactory notice of claimed infringement for these works, Comcast will respond expeditiously to either directly or indirectly (i) remove the allegedly infringing work(s) stored on the Service or the Personal Web Features or (ii) disable access to the work(s). Comcast will also notify the affected customer or user of the Service of the removal or disabling of access to the work(s).</P>
<P>Copyright owners may send Comcast a notification of claimed infringement to report alleged infringements of their works to:</P>
<P>J. Opperman &amp; M. Moleski/DMCA Notifications<BR>Comcast Cable Communications, LLC<BR>1800 Bishops Gate Drive<BR>Mount Laurel, NJ 08054 U.S.A.<BR>Phone: 888.565.4329<BR>Fax: 856.324.2940<BR>Email: <A href="mailto:dmca@comcast.net">dmca@comcast.net</A></P>
<P>Copyright owners may use their own notification of claimed infringement form that satisfies the requirements of Section 512(c)(3) of the U.S. Copyright Act. Under the DMCA, anyone who knowingly makes misrepresentations regarding alleged copyright infringement may be liable to Comcast, the alleged infringer, and the affected copyright owner for any damages incurred in connection with the removal, blocking, or replacement of allegedly infringing material.</P>
<H3>What can customers do if they receive a notification of alleged infringement?</H3>
<P>If you receive a notification of alleged infringement as described above, and you believe in good faith that the allegedly infringing works have been removed or blocked by mistake or misidentification, then you may send a counter notification to Comcast. Upon Comcast's receipt of a counter notification that satisfies the requirements of DMCA, Comcast will provide a copy of the counter notification to the person who sent the original notification of claimed infringement and will follow the DMCA's procedures with respect to a received counter notification. In all events, you expressly agree that Comcast will not be a party to any disputes or lawsuits regarding alleged copyright infringement.</P>
<P>If a notification of claimed infringement has been filed against you, you can file a counter notification with Comcast's designated agent using the contact information shown above. All counter notifications must satisfy the requirements of Section 512(g)(3) of the U.S. Copyright Act.</P>
