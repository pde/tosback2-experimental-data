<p>READ THIS INTERNET SERVICE AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE EARTHLINK AND PEOPLEPC SERVICES LISTED BELOW.</p>
<p>1. AGREEMENT</p>
<p>This Internet Service Agreement (&quot;Agreement&quot;) governs your use of the following Internet access services:</p>
<ul>
<li>EarthLink Dial-Up</li>
<li>EarthLink Residential DSL</li>
<li>PeoplePC Dial-Up</li>
<li>PeoplePC DSL</li>
<li>EarthLink MailStation</li>
<li>EarthLink Premium Mail<sup><small>1</small></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>This Agreement is between EarthLink, Inc. (EarthLink) and you as a subscriber to one of the services listed above (Service). This Agreement consists of the terms and conditions below, the specific terms of your billing plan for the Service, the <a href="http://www.earthlink.net/about/policies/privacy/">EarthLink Privacy Policy</a> and the <a href="http://www.earthlink.net/about/policies/use.faces">EarthLink Acceptable Use Policy</a>, all of which are incorporated herein. The terms and conditions in this Agreement apply to all of the above-mentioned Services except (i) the terms of Section 19 that only apply to the EarthLink Residential DSL Service and the PeoplePC DSL Service (collectively referred to as &quot;DSL Service&quot;) and (ii) the terms of Section 20 that only apply to the EarthLink Modem. </p>
<p>By establishing an account with EarthLink, or using the Service, you agree to be bound by this Agreement and to use the Service in compliance with the terms of this Agreement and all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations.</p>
<p>2. TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT</p>
<p>The effective date of this Agreement begins on your account billing start date, as indicated on your first invoice. This Agreement terminates or expires upon the termination of your account. Sections 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18 and 19 of this Agreement will survive termination or expiration of this Agreement.</p>
<p>3. REGISTRATION INFORMATION</p>
<p>To order and receive the Service, you acknowledge that you are 18 years of age or older, and you have legal authority to enter into this Agreement. You must provide EarthLink with a valid credit card, debit card or other EarthLink approved payment method for the Service. You represent that all information you provided during the registration process is accurate and complete and that you will update such information with EarthLink should it change.</p>
<p>In addition, the Service must be available to your location. The Service may require separate active telephone or cable service providers in order for the Service to work. You are responsible for charges for such telephone or cable service providers. Please note that changing telephone carriers or cable providers may result in substantial interruption of the Service and may result in fees associated with cancellation and setting up a new account.</p>
<p>EarthLink may accept or reject any potential subscriber to the Service in its sole discretion. EarthLink reserves the right to verify the accuracy of the information you submit in connection with your registration and your account and you consent to such verification. EarthLink also reserves the right to validate the payment method information you provide at registration and account updates, including attempting up to a $1.00 authorization to your credit card or debit card which is not actually billed. To understand how EarthLink handles and protects your personal information, please see the <a href="http://www.earthlink.net/about/policies/privacy/">EarthLink Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<p>EarthLink also reserves the right to change any of the features, content or applications of the Service at any time with or without notice to you.</p>
<p>4. USERNAMES, PASSWORDS, AND SECURITY</p>
<p>Upon registration, you will receive a username, a password, and other account information. You will be responsible for use of the Service by any person who uses your username and password to access the Service, whether or not you specifically authorize such person's use or actions, including maintaining the confidentiality of your username and password. You must notify EarthLink immediately upon discovering any unauthorized use of your account information. Usernames, passwords, email addresses and IP addresses are EarthLink's property and EarthLink may alter or replace them at any time.</p>
<p>You are solely responsible for (i) maintaining the security of your computer and data, including protection of your username and password, (ii) the encryption of data, and (iii) back-up and restoration of your computer and data. EarthLink recommends that you use anti-virus, anti-spyware and firewall software including appropriately updating such software.</p>
<p>5. SERVICE REQUIREMENTS FOR EARTHLINK DIAL-UP, PEOPLEPC DIAL-UP, EARTHLINK DSL AND PEOPLEPC DSL</p>
<p>The minimum computer requirements for (i) the EarthLink Dial-Up and the EarthLink Residential DSL Service are listed on the EarthLink website located at <a href="http://www.earthlink.net">www.earthlink.net</a> and (ii) the PeoplePC Dial-Up Service and the PeoplePC DSL Service are listed on the PeoplePC website located at <a href="http://www.peoplepc.com">www.peoplepc.com</a>. </p>
<p>EarthLink will ship software to you to install on your computer for the EarthLink Dial-Up Service and the PeoplePC Dial-Up Service.   If your computer does not have a modem to access a dial-up connection, you may order a modem from EarthLink (&quot;EarthLink Dial-Up Modem&quot;) to access the EarthLink Dial-Up Service or the PeoplePC Dial-Up Service (See Section 20).<sup><small>2</small></sup> </p>
<p>For the EarthLink Residential DSL Service and the PeoplePC DSL Service, EarthLink will ship the free DSL self-installation kit that will include a DSL modem (&quot;EarthLink DSL Modem&quot;) and filters in addition to software.<sup><small>3</small></sup></p>
<p>The Service speed may vary depending on location, line quality, inside wiring, Internet traffic, and other factors beyond the control of EarthLink. EarthLink does not guarantee upload or download speeds. Some line stabilization may be necessary for the Service. Stabilization could include the lowering of provisioned line speed. Should this occur, EarthLink will NOT be able to increase the line speed once the connection is stabilized. Some Services may only work using certain telephone carriers or non-PBX (including rollover/party line) phone systems. Some Services may require the use of specific hardware and/or software and may be limited by specific geographic location. The billing plans for some Services may vary by geographic location and phone carrier or cable provider. In the event that you change to a different Service, consult with an EarthLink representative regarding how such change will affect your billing plan.</p>
<p>Unless your Service includes a static IP address, you will be allocated a dynamic IP address. For the EarthLink Dial-Up Service and the PeoplePC Dial-Up Service, EarthLink reserves the right to timeout inactive connections that are excessive.</p>
<p>6. USE OF THE SERVICE</p>
<p>You represent that when you transmit, upload, post or submit any content, images or data using the Service you have the legal right to do so and that your use of such data or content does not violate any law (including copyright or trademark laws) or any other third party rights. You agree that EarthLink has no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, value or usefulness of any content, advice or opinions contained in any emails, third party web sites, message boards, chat rooms, social networks or online services. The Internet may contain material that is unsuitable for minors, and you agree to supervise and to accept sole responsibility and liability for any use of the Service by minors through your account. Your use of the Service is also governed by the <a href="http://www.earthlink.net/about/policies/use.faces">EarthLink Acceptable Use Policy</a> and the <a href="http://www.earthlink.net/about/policies/privacy/">EarthLink Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<p>The email storage limits for your billing plan are posted on the EarthLink website located at <a href="http://www.earthlink.net">www.earthlink.net</a> or the PeoplePC website located at <a href="http://www.peoplepc.com">www.peoplepc.com</a>. If your mailbox is approaching the storage limit for your Service, it will be noted visually on your web mail. EarthLink also will send email notices to this mailbox stating you are approaching your email storage limit. When your mailbox exceeds the allotted email storage space, you will receive a second email warning from EarthLink that your email storage is over quota and then EarthLink will stop transmitting email messages to your inbox. Any incoming emails will be bounced with an error message to the sender stating that your mailbox is full. After you delete some email messages to free up some space, new messages will be accepted again. You may purchase additional storage up to a fixed limit as described at <a href="https://.myaccount.earthlink.net">https://.myaccount.earthlink.net</a> or <a href="https://myacount.peoplepc.com">https://myacount.peoplepc.com</a>.</p>
<p>Certain billing plans may offer the ability to create your personal webspace. The maximum webspace available for such use is 10MB per email account. Limitations may include, but are not limited to, certain software and certain operating systems. You agree to use your personal webspace in compliance with the terms of the <a href="http://www.earthlink.net/about/policies/use.faces">EarthLink Acceptable Use Policy</a>. In the event that one of your personal webspace exceeds 10 MB, no additional information can be uploaded to it. If the traffic on one of your personal webspace exceeds 1 GB of webspace in a calendar month, such personal webspace will be shut down until the next calendar month. If you want more space or bandwidth for your personal webspace, you can subscribe to the EarthLink Web Hosting Service.</p>
<p>EarthLink Dial-Up and PeoplePC Dial-Up accounts permit a dial-up connection to the Internet from only one computer at a time without incurring additional fees; however, if two or more computers are logged into an EarthLink Dial-Up account or a PeoplePC Dial-Up account to access the Internet at the same time (&quot;Simultaneous Usage&quot;), Simultaneous Usage charges will accrue for that month. The Simultaneous Usage fee is $1.00 per hour, pro-rated to the minute, through the end of the monthly billing cycle. The Simultaneous Usage fee will be added to your monthly bill. Although some EarthLink Dial-Up and PeoplePC Dial-Up plans come with multiple email addresses, Simultaneous Usage charges will accrue if two or more dial-up connections from one Dial-Up account are accessing more than one of these email addresses at the same time. </p>
<p>EarthLink Residential DSL and PeoplePC DSL customers also may accrue Simultaneous Usage fees if accessing the Internet through a dial-up modem. DSL Service accounts allow up to 20 hours per month of dial-up modem access to the Internet. If you access the Internet via two or more dial-up modem connections at the same time using the same DSL Service account, Simultaneous Usage charges will accrue for that month. If you have a DSL account, your primary connection via the DSL Service does not count toward the Simultaneous Usage calculations.</p>
<p>7. LOCAL TELEPHONE, TOLL AND LONG DISTANCE CHARGE</p>
<p>When using the Service, you are solely responsible for determining if use of a particular dial-up number, if applicable, will cause you to incur long-distance, toll, or any other charges, including Simultaneous Usage charges. EarthLink does not guarantee that any dial-up access numbers EarthLink provides will be a local call from your location. EarthLink is not responsible for any long-distance, toll, or other charges you incur. Toll-free (800, 888, 877), international, and Simultaneous Usage access costs will be extra.</p>
<p>EarthLink may change its POP numbers at any time. EarthLink reserves the right to direct you to use certain numbers to access the Service or to restrict use of specific access numbers. </p>
<p>8. BILLING AND PAYMENT</p>
<p>You agree to pay the monthly fees in your billing plan for the Service and to pay (i) applicable taxes, surcharges, and fees required by any applicable government entity and (ii) other applicable fees and charges. Depending on the billing plan for your Service, the other fees and charges may include hardware fees, activation fees, early termination fees, method of payment fees, or shipping and handling fees. If your billing plan is based on a monthly subscription fee in addition to any of the aforementioned charges, you will be billed a flat monthly fee. If your billing plan is based on usage, you will be billed each month based on usage. EarthLink reserves the right to change the monthly fees of your billing plan upon 30 days prior notice to your EarthLink or PeoplePC contact email address on file prior to the effective date of such new monthly fee. All payments must be made in US dollars.</p>
<p>All charges are considered valid unless disputed in writing within 30 days of the billing date and mailed to:</p>
<p>EarthLink, Inc.<br />
  Customer Service<br />
  1375 Peachtree Street<br />
  Level A<br />
Atlanta, Georgia 30309</p>
<p>Adjustments will not be made for charges that are disputed more than 30 days after the billing date.</p>
<p>Charges may be billed on or after your billing cycle date to your method of payment on file each month for the Service including any additional usage, services, taxes and fees. EarthLink is not responsible for any charges or resulting from charges billed by EarthLink including, but not limited to, overdrawn accounts or exceeding credit card limits. EarthLink may use various means to recover monies due. If EarthLink uses a collection agency or uses legal action to recover monies due, you agree to pay all fees arising from or relating to the recovery of such monies, including attorneys' fees.</p>
<p>If you provided EarthLink with a valid credit card or debit card, you agree to maintain valid and current credit card or debit card information on file with EarthLink at all times. You acknowledge and agree that you authorize EarthLink and that EarthLink does not need to obtain any additional authorization from you for any recurring payments or automatic billing options. In addition, if your credit or debit card company provides updated credit card or debit card information to EarthLink, you acknowledge that EarthLink does not need to obtain authorization from you for EarthLink to use such information to update your credit card or debit card on file. </p>
<p>If payment by check has been accepted by EarthLink, then payments by check must be received by EarthLink by the due date listed in your monthly invoice. When you pay your fees by check, you authorize EarthLink to electronically process your payment. If your check is processed electronically, your checking account may be debited on the same day as EarthLink receives your check and neither your check nor a copy of your check will be included with your checking account statement. EarthLink will charge a fee for returned checks or returned bank drafts from your financial institution.</p>
<p>If you signed up for a pre-paid billing plan, you will receive the Service for the duration of your membership term without further monthly Service fees. Depending on which pre-paid billing plan you signed up under, your membership may convert to either a monthly or a fixed period membership at the end of the fixed pre-paid membership term. Pricing will be subject to the rates in effect at that time for that Service. If you cancel your membership before the end of the fixed term or if EarthLink terminates your membership for violations of this Agreement or other applicable EarthLink agreements or policies, and you have paid EarthLink in advance, the amount you have paid for your membership will not be refunded in whole or in part.</p>
<p>Your account will be automatically inactivated if you put a stop payment on your account with your financial institution in connection with payment of your monthly bill.</p>

<p>EarthLink may terminate your account at any time for any reason, including, without limitation, if (i) your account is delinquent because charges on your method of payment were refused for any reason, you failed to make payment when due or you did not provide EarthLink with a new charge card, or debit card expiration date or expiration date of any other method of payment before the existing date expired; (ii) EarthLink, in its sole discretion, believes you have breached this Agreement, other EarthLink agreements or other EarthLink policies; or (iii) your use of the Services is prohibited by law.

In certain situations, EarthLink may waive the early termination fee, including, but not limited to, if (i) EarthLink no longer provides the Service to your current location, (ii) you live in an area currently deemed a weather or war disaster area or (iii) you were deployed for active military service. </p>
<p>On the inactivation date of your Service, your Service will be terminated and you will no longer have access to your email, files or other information on EarthLink's servers without further notice to you.

<p>You may not assign your rights or delegate any of your duties under this Agreement without the prior written consent of EarthLink, and any attempted assignment or delegation without such consent will be void.

EarthLink will amend or replace such provision with one that is valid and enforceable and which achieves, to the extent possible, the original objectives and intent of EarthLink as reflected in the original provision. Nothing in this Agreement or in the understanding of the parties confers upon the parties the status of agency, partnership, or other form of joint enterprise between the parties. EarthLink may subcontract any work, obligations or other performance required of EarthLink under this Agreement without your consent. EarthLink will not be liable for delays, damages or failures in performance because of causes beyond its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of a government in its sovereign capacity, acts of war, terrorism, acts of a public enemy, fires, earthquakes, acts of God, labor disputes, strikes, work slow-downs or other labor-related activity.</p>
<p>19. ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR THE DSL SERVICE AND THE EARTHLINK DSL MODEM</p>
<p>This Section 19 explains the additional terms and conditions specific to the DSL Service and the EarthLink DSL Modem. EarthLink charges a shipping and handling fee for shipping the DSL self-installation kit to you. The free DSL self-installation kit includes the software needed to begin using the DSL Service and the EarthLink DSL Modem and filters. After your payment of the shipping and handling fee clears, EarthLink will begin the provisioning process which includes shipping the DSL self-installation kit to you. EarthLink recommends use of such EarthLink DSL Modem in order to ensure proper ongoing support for the DSL Service; however, if you decide to use another provider's modem, the provisioning process will begin immediately after sign-up.</p>
<p>The installation, use, inspection, maintenance, repair, and removal of the EarthLink DSL Modem may result in a Service outage or potential damage to your computer. You are solely responsible for backing up all of your existing computer files and data. The EarthLink Parties will have no liability whatsoever for any damage to or loss or destruction of any of your hardware, software, files, data, or peripherals. You assume responsibility for impacts to or loss of any warranty associated with the opening of your computer for installation purposes.</p>
<p>If you are unable to perform the self-installation of the EarthLink DSL Modem, EarthLink may suggest an outside vendor to help install the EarthLink DSL Modem. You will be responsible for all costs and scheduling associated with the installation of the EarthLink DSL Modem by a third party. You are also responsible for all inside wiring repair necessary to install the EarthLink DSL Modem. If you are not the owner of the premises, you warrant that you have obtained the consent of the owner for vendor personnel and/or its agents to enter the premises for installation. You will indemnify, defend and hold the EarthLink Parties harmless from and against any claims of the owner of the premises arising out of the performance of this Agreement.</p>
<p>EARTHLINK DOES NOT REPRESENT, WARRANT, OR COVENANT THAT INSTALLATION BY YOU OR A THIRD PARTY CHOSEN BY YOU WILL ENABLE YOU TO SUCCESSFULLY ACCESS, OPERATE, OR USE THE SERVICE, NOR THAT SUCH INSTALLATION WILL NOT CAUSE DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER, DATA, SOFTWARE, FILES, OR PERIPHERALS.</p>
<p>THE EARTHLINK PARTIES WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY WHATSOEVER FOR ANY DAMAGE, OR FOR THE FAILURE TO PROPERLY INSTALL, ACCESS, USE, OR OPERATE THE EARTHLINK DSL MODEM OR THE DSL SERVICE BECAUSE OF YOUR INSTALLATION. THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS IN ADDITION TO AND WILL IN NO WAY BE CONSTRUED TO LIMIT ANY AND ALL LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH ELSEWHERE IN THIS AGREEMENT.</p>
<p>Because of the complex nature of Internet service, availability, and the underlying infrastructure, it may not be possible to provide the DSL Service to everyone. In its sole discretion, EarthLink may cancel the installation process and refund any money that you have paid. EarthLink will notify you of its intent to cancel as soon as reasonably possible. It may take up to 90 days to determine if EarthLink is able to provide the  DSL Service. The EarthLink Parties will have no responsibility whatsoever for claims arising out of EarthLink's failure or refusal to complete the installation or provide the DSL Service.</p>
<p>Changes to your DSL Service billing plan in months two through twelve may result in an early termination fee. Such changes may include (i) cancellation of your DSL Service, (ii) downgrading or changing your DSL Service to another EarthLink or PeoplePC Service, or (iii) if you move the DSL Service to a new location, change your local telephone company within the same location or discontinue your local telephone service within the same location.</p>
<p>If you move your DSL Service or change your local telephone company and EarthLink can provide the DSL Service at the new location or on the new telephone line, you must pay a reactivation fee because this change requires a new installation; however, EarthLink will credit a portion of any early termination fee to your account providing you reactivate the DSL Service and begin a new billing plan within 60 days from the date you terminated the previous DSL Service. If EarthLink cannot provide the DSL Service in your new location on your new telephone line, you will be charged the early termination fee.</p>
<p>If you cancel your DSL Service account within the first 35 days from the shipment date of your EarthLink DSL Modem, you must return your EarthLink DSL Modem. EarthLink will mail you a prepaid return shipping label upon cancellation and will not accept returns without an EarthLink-supplied shipping label. All EarthLink DSL Modem returns must have an EarthLink supplied shipping label or they will be rejected.</p>
<p>If you cancel your account and return your EarthLink DSL Modem in its original packaging (or equivalent) using an EarthLink supplied return shipping label within 35 days from the shipment date of your EarthLink DSL Modem, EarthLink will refund certain fees incurred up to the cancellation date, excluding charges for certain usage, for example: international calls, directory assistance and other metered usage, applicable taxes or other governmental fees, shipping and handling. </p>
<p>EarthLink warrants the EarthLink DSL Modem against defects in material and workmanship for a warranty period of one year starting from the shipment date. This warranty applies to the original end-user purchaser and is not transferable.  EarthLink, at its option, will repair or replace your original EarthLink DSL Modem that proves to be defective on an active account because of manufacturer's defect at no cost to you provided that (i) you call the EarthLink Technical Support Department within one year of your original shipment date; (ii) the EarthLink Technical Support Department certifies that a defect has occurred; and (iii) you return your EarthLink DSL Modem in its original packaging (or equivalent) using the EarthLink provided prepaid shipping label within 30 days of certification by the EarthLink Technical Support Department. Upon certification, EarthLink will ship a replacement EarthLink DSL Modem to you. This warranty does not cover defects resulting from use of the EarthLink DSL Modem contrary to the instructions or repair or modification by any party other than EarthLink. EarthLink will not replace any EarthLink DSL Modem with a new component without a fee after one year from your original shipment date.   Failure to return the certified EarthLink DSL Modem within 30 days of certification will result in a charge for the new EarthLink DSL Modem. This warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights that vary from state to state.<sup><small>5</small></sup></p>
<p>20.  ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR THE EARTHLINK DIAL-UP MODEM</p>

<p>The EarthLink Dial-Up Modem package will include printed instructions explaining how to install the EarthLink Dial-Up Modem in your computer.   If you have any problems with installation of the EarthLink Dial-Up Modem, you can contact EarthLink Technical Support for assistance. If you are unable to perform the self-installation of the EarthLink Dial-Up Modem, EarthLink Technical Support may suggest an outside vendor to assist you with its installation. You will be responsible for all costs and scheduling associated with the installation of the EarthLink Dial-Up Modem a third party.</p>
<p>The installation, use, inspection, maintenance, repair, and removal of the EarthLink Dial-Up Modem may result in a Service outage or potential damage to your computer. You are solely responsible for backing up all of your existing computer files and data. The EarthLink Parties will have no liability whatsoever for any damage to or loss or destruction of any of your hardware, software, files, data, or peripherals. </p>
<p>EARTHLINK DOES NOT REPRESENT, WARRANT, OR COVENANT THAT INSTALLATION BY YOU OR A THIRD PARTY CHOSEN BY YOU WILL ENABLE YOU TO SUCCESSFULLY ACCESS, OPERATE, OR USE THE SERVICE, NOR THAT SUCH INSTALLATION WILL NOT CAUSE DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER, DATA, SOFTWARE, FILES, OR PERIPHERALS.</p>
<p>THE EARTHLINK PARTIES WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY WHATSOEVER FOR ANY DAMAGE, OR FOR THE FAILURE TO PROPERLY INSTALL, ACCESS, USE, OR OPERATE THE EARTHLINK DIAL-UP MODEM OR THE  SERVICE BECAUSE OF YOUR INSTALLATION. THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS IN ADDITION TO AND WILL IN NO WAY BE CONSTRUED TO LIMIT ANY AND ALL LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH ELSEWHERE IN THIS AGREEMENT.</p>
<p>You may cancel your order for your EarthLink Dial-Up Modem by calling EarthLink within thirty-five (35) days from the date of shipment in order to receive a refund. EarthLink will mail you a prepaid return shipping label after this call. All EarthLink Dial-Up Modem returns must be shipped with the EarthLink supplied shipping label or they will be rejected.  Upon receipt of the returned EarthLink Dial-Up Modem, EarthLink will send you a refund of your original payment.</p>
<p>EarthLink warrants the EarthLink Dial-Up Modem against defects in material and workmanship for a warranty period of one year starting from the shipment date. This warranty applies to the original end-user purchaser and is not transferable.  EarthLink, at its option, will repair or replace your original EarthLink Dial-Up Modem that proves to be defective on an active account because of manufacturer's defect at no cost to you provided that (i) you call the EarthLink Technical Support Department within one year of your original shipment date; (ii) the EarthLink Technical Support Department certifies that a defect has occurred; and (iii) you return the EarthLink Dial-Up Modem within 30 days of certification by the EarthLink Technical Support Department using the EarthLink prepaid return shipping label. This warranty does not cover defects resulting from use of the EarthLink Dial-Up Modem contrary to the instructions or repair or modification by any party other than EarthLink.  EarthLink will not replace your EarthLink Dial-Up Modem without a fee if you call EarthLink Technical Support Department about the defect in your EarthLink Dial-Up Modem after one year from your original shipment date.  This warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights that vary from state to state.<sup><small>6</small></sup></p>
