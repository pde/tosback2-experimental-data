CRAIGSLIST TERMS OF USE


1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS

craigslist provides a collection of online resources, including classified 
ads, forums, and various email services, (referred to hereafter as "the 
Service") subject to the following Terms of Use ("TOU"). By using the Service 
in any way, you are agreeing to comply with the TOU. In addition, when using 
particular craigslist services, you agree to abide by any applicable posted 
guidelines for all craigslist services, which may change from time to time.  
Should you object to any term or condition of the TOU, any guidelines, 
or any subsequent modifications thereto or become dissatisfied with craigslist 
in any way, your only recourse is to immediately discontinue use of craigslist.  
craigslist has the right, but is not obligated, to strictly enforce the TOU 
through self-help, community moderation, active investigation, litigation and 
prosecution.


2. MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify or otherwise 
alter these terms and conditions at any time.  Such modifications shall become 
effective immediately upon the posting thereof. You must review this agreement 
on a regular basis to keep yourself apprised of any changes. You can find the 
most recent version of the TOU at:

http://www.craigslist.org/about/terms.of.use.html 


3. CONTENT

You understand that all postings, messages, text, files, images, photos, 
video, sounds, or other materials ("Content") posted on, transmitted 
through, or linked from the Service, are the sole responsibility of the 
person from whom such Content originated. More specifically, you are 
entirely responsible for each individual item ("Item") of Content that you 
post, email or otherwise make available via the Service. You understand that 
craigslist does not control, and is not responsible for Content made available 
through the Service, and that by using the Service, you may be exposed to 
Content that is offensive, indecent, inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise 
objectionable. Furthermore, the craigslist site and Content available through 
the Service may contain links to other websites, which are completely 
independent of craigslist.  craigslist makes no representation or warranty as 
to the accuracy, completeness or authenticity of the information contained 
in any such site.  Your linking to any other webites is at your own risk. 
You agree that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the 
use of any Content, that you may not rely on said Content, and that under no 
circumstances will craigslist be liable in any way for any Content or for 
any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content 
posted, emailed or otherwise made available via the Service. You acknowledge 
that craigslist does not pre-screen or approve Content, but that craigslist 
shall have the right (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to 
refuse, delete or move any Content that is available via the Service, for 
violating the letter or spirit of the TOU or for any other reason.


4. THIRD PARTY CONTENT, SITES, AND SERVICES

The craigslist site and Content available through the Service may contain 
features and functionalities that may link you or provide you with access 
to third party content which is completely independent of craigslist, 
including web sites, directories, servers, networks, systems, information 
and databases, applications, software, programs, products or services, 
and the Internet as a whole.  

Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through 
the Service, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any 
other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such 
dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals.  
You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate 
before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these 
third parties.  

You agree that craigslist shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or 
damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings. If there is 
a dispute between participants on this site, or between users and any third 
party, you understand and agree that craigslist is under no obligation to 
become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other 
users, you hereby release craigslist, its officers, employees, agents and 
successors in rights from claims, demands and damages (actual and 
consequential) of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected and 
unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related 
to such disputes and / or our service. If you are a California resident, you 
waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: "A general release does 
not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in 
his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must 
have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."  


5.  NOTIFICATION OF CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENT

If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes 
copyright infringement, or your intellectual property rights have been 
otherwise violated, please notify craigslist's agent for notice of claims of 
copyright or other intellectual property infringement ("Agent"), at

abuse@craigslist.org

8. POSTING AGENTS

A "Posting Agent" is a third-party agent, service, or intermediary

moderate demands on craigslist's resources, you may not use a Posting 
Agent to post Content to the Service without express permission or 
license from craigslist.  Correspondingly, Posting Agents are not 
permitted to post Content on behalf of others, to cause Content to 
be so posted, or otherwise access the Service to facilitate posting 
Content on behalf of others, except with express permission or 
license from craigslist.


9. NO SPAM POLICY

You understand and agree that sending unsolicited email advertisements to 
craigslist email addresses or through craigslist computer systems, which is 
expressly prohibited by these Terms, will use or cause to be used servers 
located in California.  Any unauthorized use of craigslist computer systems 
is a violation of these Terms and certain federal and state laws, including 
without limitation the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (18 U.S.C. Â§ 1030 et 
seq.), Section 502 of the California Penal Code and Section 17538.45 of the 
California Business and Professions Code.  Such violations may subject the 
sender and his or her agents to civil and criminal penalties.


10. PAID POSTINGS

We may charge a fee to post Content in some areas of the Service. The fee
is an access fee permitting Content to be posted in a designated area.
Each party posting Content to the Service is responsible for said Content
and compliance with the TOU. All fees paid will be non-refundable in the
event that Content is removed from the Service for violating the TOU.


11. LIMITATIONS ON SERVICE

You acknowledge that craigslist may establish limits concerning use of the 
Service, including the maximum number of days that Content will be retained 
by the Service, the maximum number and size of postings, email messages, or 
other Content that may be transmitted or stored by the Service, and the 
frequency with which you may access the Service. You agree that craigslist 
has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store any 
Content maintained or transmitted by the Service. You acknowledge that 
craigslist reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue the 
Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice, and that craigslist 
shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, 
suspension or discontinuance of the Service.


12. ACCESS TO THE SERVICE

craigslist grants you a limited, revocable, nonexclusive license to access 
the Service for your own personal use.  This license does not include: 
(a) access to the Service by Posting Agents; or (b) any collection, 
aggregation, copying, duplication, display or derivative use of the Service 
nor any use of data mining, robots, spiders, or similar data gathering and 
extraction tools for any purpose unless expressly permitted by craigslist. 
A limited exception to (b) is provided to general purpose internet search 
engines and non-commercial public archives that use such tools to gather 
information for the sole purpose of displaying hyperlinks to the Service, 
provided they each do so from a stable IP address or range of IP addresses 
using an easily identifiable agent and comply with our robots.txt file. 
"General purpose internet search engine" does not include a website or 
search engine or other service that specializes in classified listings 
or in any subset of classifieds listings such as jobs, housing, for sale, 
services, or personals, or which is in the business of providing classified 
ad listing services.

craigslist permits you to display on your website, or create a hyperlink 
on your website to, individual postings on the Service so long as such use 
is for noncommercial and/or news reporting purposes only (e.g., for use in 
personal web blogs or personal online media).  If the total number of such 
postings displayed or linked to on your website exceeds one hundred (100) 
postings, your use will be presumed to be in violation of the TOU, 
absent express permission granted by craigslist to do so.  You may also 
create a hyperlink to the home page of craigslist sites so long as the 
link does not portray craigslist, its employees, or its affiliates in a 
false, misleading, derogatory, or otherwise offensive matter.

craigslist offers various parts of the Service in RSS format so that users 
can embed individual feeds into a personal website or blog, or view postings 
through third party software news aggregators.  craigslist permits you to 
display, excerpt from, and link to the RSS feeds on your personal website 
or personal web blog, provided that (a) your use of the RSS feed is for 
personal, non-commercial purposes only, (b) each title is correctly linked 
back to the original post on the Service and redirects the user to the 
post when the user clicks on it, (c) you provide, adjacent to the RSS 
feed, proper attribution to 'craigslist' as the source, (d) your use or 
display does not suggest that craigslist promotes or endorses any third 
party causes, ideas, web sites, products or services, (e) you do not 
redistribute the RSS feed, and (f) your use does not overburden 
craigslist's systems.  craigslist reserves all rights in the content of 
the RSS feeds and may terminate any RSS feed at any time.

Use of the Service beyond the scope of authorized access granted to you by 
craigslist immediately terminates said permission or license.  In order to 
collect, aggregate, copy, duplicate, display or make derivative use of the 
the Service or any Content made available via the Service for other 
purposes (including commercial purposes) not stated herein, you must first 
obtain a license from craigslist.


13. TERMINATION OF SERVICE

You agree that craigslist, in its sole discretion, has the right (but not 
the obligation) to delete or deactivate your account, block your email or IP 
address, or otherwise terminate your access to or use of the Service (or any 
part thereof), immediately and without notice, and remove and discard any 
Content within the Service, for any reason, including, without limitation, 
if craigslist believes that you have acted inconsistently with the letter or 
spirit of the TOU. Further, you agree that craigslist shall not be liable 
to you or any third-party for any termination of your access to the Service.  
Further, you agree not to attempt to use the Service after said termination.  
Sections 2, 4, 6 and 10-16 shall survive termination of the TOU.


14. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS

The Service is protected to the maximum extent permitted by copyright laws 
and international treaties. Content displayed on or through the Service is 
protected by copyright as a collective work and/or compilation, pursuant to 
copyrights laws, and international conventions. Any reproduction, 
modification, creation of derivative works from or redistribution of the 
site or the collective work, and/or copying or reproducing the sites 
or any portion thereof to any other server or location for further

written consent of craigslist. You further agree not to reproduce, 
duplicate or copy Content from the Service without the express written 
consent of craigslist, and agree to abide by any and all copyright notices 
displayed on the Service. You may not decompile or disassemble, reverse 
engineer or otherwise attempt to discover any source code contained in the 
Service. Without limiting the foregoing, you agree not to reproduce, 
duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit for any commercial purposes, any 
aspect of the Service. CRAIGSLIST is a registered mark in the U.S. Patent 
and Trademark Office.

Although craigslist does not claim ownership of content that its users post, 
by posting Content to any public area of the Service, you automatically 
grant, and you represent and warrant that you have the right to grant, to 
craigslist an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, fully paid, worldwide 
license to use, copy, perform, display, and distribute said Content and to 
prepare derivative works of, or incorporate into other works, said Content, 
and to grant and authorize sublicenses (through multiple tiers) of the 
foregoing. Furthermore, by posting Content to any public area of the Service, 
you automatically grant craigslist all rights necessary to prohibit any 
subsequent aggregation, display, copying, duplication, reproduction, or 
exploitation of the Content on the Service by any party for any purpose.

not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties.  In such jurisdictions, some 
of the foregoing disclaimers may not apply to you insofar as they relate to 
implied warranties.


16. LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL CRAIGSLIST BE LIABLE FOR DIRECT, INDIRECT, 
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (EVEN IF CRAIGSLIST 
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), RESULTING FROM ANY 
ASPECT OF YOUR USE OF THE CRAIGSLIST SITE OR THE SERVICE, WHETHER THE 
DAMAGES ARISE FROM USE OR MISUSE OF THE CRAIGSLIST SITE OR THE SERVICE, FROM 
INABILITY TO USE THE CRAIGSLIST SITE OR THE SERVICE, OR THE INTERRUPTION,

17. INDEMNITY

You agree to indemnify and hold craigslist, its officers, subsidiaries, 
affiliates, successors, assigns, directors, officers, agents, service 
providers, suppliers and employees, harmless from any claim or demand, 
including reasonable attorney fees and court costs, made by any third party 
due to or arising out of Content you submit, post or make available through 
the Service, your use of the Service, your violation of the TOU, your 
breach of any of the representations and warranties herein, or your 
violation of any rights of another.


18. GENERAL INFORMATION

The TOU constitute the entire agreement between you and craigslist and 
govern your use of the Service, superceding any prior agreements between you 
and craigslist. The TOU and the relationship between you and craigslist 
shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to 
its conflict of law provisions. You and craigslist agree to submit to the 
personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county 
of San Francisco, California. The failure of craigslist to exercise or 
enforce any right or provision of the TOU shall not constitute a waiver of 
such right or provision. If any provision of the TOU is found by a court 
of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that 
the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as 
reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the TOU remain in 
full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to 
the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use 
of the Service or the TOU must be filed within one (1) year after such 
claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.


19. VIOLATION OF TERMS AND LIQUIDATED DAMAGES

Please report any violations of the TOU, by flagging the posting(s) for 
review, or by emailing to:

abuse@craigslist.org

Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our 
right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.

You understand and agree that, because damages are often difficult to quantify, 
if it becomes necessary for craigslist to pursue legal action to enforce these 
Terms, you will be liable to pay craigslist the following amounts as liquidated 
damages, which you accept as reasonable estimates of craigslists' damages for 
the specified breaches of these Terms:

a. If you post a message that (1) impersonates any person or entity; (2) 
falsely states or otherwise misrepresents your affiliation with a person or 
entity; or (3) that includes personal or identifying information about 
another person without that person's explicit consent, you agree to pay 
craigslist one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each such message.  
This provision does not apply to Content that constitutes lawful non-deceptive 
parody of public figures.

b. If craigslist establishes limits on the frequency with which you may 
access the Service, or terminates your access to or use of the Service, you 
agree to pay craigslist one hundred dollars ($100) for each message posted 
in excess of such limits or for each day on which you access craigslist in 
excess of such limits, whichever is higher.

c. If you send unsolicited email advertisements to craigslist email 
addresses or through craigslist computer systems, you agree to pay 
craigslist twenty five dollars ($25) for each such email.

d. If you post Content in violation of the TOU, other than as described 
above, you agree to pay craigslist one hundred dollars ($100) for each 
Item of Content posted.  In its sole discretion, craigslist may elect 
to issue a warning before assessing damages.

e. If you are a Posting Agent that uses the Service in violation of the
TOU, in addition to any liquidated damages under clause (d), you agree to
pay craigslist one hundred dollars ($100) for each and every Item you post
in violation of the TOU.  A Posting Agent will also be deemed an agent of
the party engaging the Posting Agent to access the Service (the
"Principal"), and the Principal (by engaging the Posting Agent in
violation of the TOU) agrees to pay craigslist an additional one hundred
dollars ($100) for each Item posted by the Posting Agent on behalf of
the Principal in violation of the TOU.

f. If you aggregate, display, copy, duplicate, reproduce, or otherwise 
exploit for any purpose any Content (except for your own Content) in 
violation of these Terms without craigslist's express written permission, 
you agree to pay craigslist three thousand dollars ($3,000) for each day 
on which you engage in such conduct.

Otherwise, you agree to pay craigslist's actual damages, to the extent such 
actual damages can be reasonably calculated. Notwithstanding any other 
provision of these Terms, craigslist retains the right to seek the remedy 
of specific performance of any term contained in these Terms, or a preliminary 
or permanent injunction against the breach of any such term or in aid of the 
exercise of any power granted in these Terms, or any combination thereof.
