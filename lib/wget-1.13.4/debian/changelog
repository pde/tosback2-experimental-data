wget (1.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * It now calls daemon(3) when working in the background (-b). This makes

    session. This made ssh hang when one started `wget -b' and logged out.
  * Minor fix to Spanish translation.
  * Made it print numbers using the proper locale symbols for the decimal
    separator and thousands grouping.

 -- Nicolás Lichtmaier <nick@debian.org>  Sat, 11 Aug 2001 15:22:16 -0300

wget (1.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes:Bug#102424,Bug#100154).
  * The manpage is now automatically generated from the texinfo source.
    I've readded the EXAMPLES section to it. Configuration file options
    and conceptual descriptions are only in the info docs for now (so
    this closes:Bug#97484, which was about an error in the documented startup
    options) and...
    * In the new manpage -U is documented (closes:Bug#92663).
    * Passive_ftp option not in manpage, but there are no more config
      options there! (closes:Bug#97982).
  * It now correctly prints accented characters (closes:Bug#97582).
  * Added build-depends for perl, since wget now uses pod2man.
  * Merged the new upstream Spanish translation with my old one.
  * Fixed a message in http.c so it can be translated properly.

 -- Nicolás Lichtmaier <nick@debian.org>  Tue,  7 Aug 2001 10:01:29 -0300

wget (1.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes:Bug#81130).
    * This version seems to properly converts HTML entities
      (closes:Bug#65790).
    * Now supports non-compliant redirections with a relative URL in their
      Location: headers (closes:Bug#62431,Bug#64449).
    * It now longer converts // in URLs to / outside of the path area of the
      URL (closes:Bug#61386).
  * Updated Spanish translation.
  * Updated manpage to 1.6 version.
  * Merged previous Debian patches to this new release.
  * The sort version of the --cache option was missing from the getopt
    invocation, now -C works (closes:Bug#67106).
  * Added `setlocale (LC_CTYPE, "")' to enable the display of non-ASCII
    characters in localized messages.

    * Fixed small memory leak.
    * Why does it free memory allocated with alloca()? Fixed.
    * Follow "<link href=" and "<script src=" (closes:Bug#69162,Bug#37273).
    * Follows correctly links with two '#' markers. The fix was completelly
      broken upstream.
    * Function store_hostaddress in host.c wasn't 64 bit clean. Better
      fix than upstream's: Use the proper 32 bit type for the IPv4 address
      instead of using whatever the architecture has as an `unsigned long'
      and adding "sizeof (unsigned long) - 4" to the pointer (eew!).
      Replace obsolete function inet_addr with inet_aton.
  * Started Spanish translation. It's incomplete, but it will improve.
