After cloning the git repository, you need to execute this command:

git submodule update --init --recursive

That will fetch a recent version of the GitPython code, which we depend upon.

*BUGS IN WGET*

If you want to actually run the crawler yourself (not really necessary unless
you're testing something), be aware that TOSBack2 also exposes a number of
bugs in common versions of wget.  As of December 2011, there are two bugs you
might need to patch yourself!

1. Versions of wget built against
   gnutls may suffer from fatal memory leaks 
   https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-wget/2011-10/msg00050.html
   (so apply that patch, or build against openssl using ./configure --with-ssl=openssl).

2. You should also apply the following patch 
   https://savannah.gnu.org/support/download.php?file_id=24473
   to fix this bug: https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?21714
